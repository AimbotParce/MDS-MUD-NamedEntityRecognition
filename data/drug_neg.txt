against
the
potential

[
Hippocampus
as
interaction
sites
between
cerebral
memory
systems
]
Most
of
the
current
theories
assume
that
there
are
multiple
forms
of
memory
that
are
supported
by
separate
brain
systems
and
have
different
characteristics
.
Animals
studies
on
the
various
dual-memory
theories
have
been
carried
out
mainly
on
the
basis
of
hippocampal
system
function
.
Specifically
,
they
have
focused
on
aspects
of
learning
and
memory
that
are
impaired
(
vs.
spared
)
by
lesions
of
the
hippocampal
formation
.
However
,
there
are
several
instances
in
the
animal
literature
showing
that
hippocampal
lesions
actually
produced
enhanced
learning
and
memory
function
.
Moreover
,
the
acquisition
of
tasks
that
are
facilitated
by
hippocampal
lesions
(
or
dysfunction
)
is
nevertheless
associated
,
in
intact
subjects
,
with
specific
neurobiological
alterations
in
the
hippocampus
.
This
problem
has
been
analysed
using
two
different
tasks
in
mice
:
a
bar-press
conditioning
and
a
spatial
discrimination
task
.
Results
showed
that
,
depending
on
the
task
considered
,
the
same
pharmacological
treatment
produced
either
a
facilitation
or
an
impairment
of
acquisition
.
Moreover
,
each
task
induced
significant
alterations
in
hippocampal
adenylate
cyclase
activity
but
in
opposite
directions
.
Together
with
previous
findings
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
hippocampus
is
involved
in
both
the
so-called
``
hippocampal-dependent
''
``
hippocampal-independent
''
forms
of
memory
.
It
is
postulated
that
some
of
the
observed
training-induced
neurobiological
alterations
might
reflect
the
interaction
between
two
(
or
more
)
competing
memory
systems
at
the
hippocampal
level
.
Thus
,
in
addition
to
its
proposed
specific
information
processing
functions
(
i.e.
,
relational
)
,
the
hippocampus
would
play
a
role
in
addressing
information
to
the
brain
memory
system
that
,
in
a
given
situation
,
has
the
best
adaptive
value
.

In

an
increased
incidence
of
thrombopenia
with

It
has
been

This

In
this
study
we
investigated
whether
also
glycine
fulfils
the
function
as
co-activator
in
glutamatergic
activation
of
NMDA
receptors
in
the
neuronal
apparatus
of
spontaneous

in
chick
embryos

The
successive
application

and
glutamate
(
15
mg/kg

)
in
a
10

interval
significantly
increased
the
activation
of
spontaneous
motility
of
17-day-old
chick
embryos
in
comparison
with
the
effect

In
13-day-old
embryos
,
glycine
was
ineffective
in
both
doses

It
is
concluded
from
these
results
that
the
modulatory
effect
of
glycine
is
evidently
a
later
developmental
acquisition
(
after
day

of
incubation

in
the
embryogenesis
of

Other
beta
adrenergic
aerosol
bronchodilators
should
not
be
used
concomitantly
with
Alupent
(
metaproterenol

)
because
they
may
have
additive
effects
.
Beta
adrenergic
agonists
should
be
administered
with
caution
to
patients
being
treated
with
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
or
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
since
the
action
of
beta
adrenergic
agonists
on
the
vascular
system
may
be
potentiated
.
The
effects
of
ERGOMAR
may
be
potentiated
by
triacetyloleandomycin
which
inhibits

The

Some
of
the
CNS

symptoms
may
be
related
to
the
underlying
disease
rather
than
to

The
following
laboratory
tests
have
been
found
to
be
abnormal
in
a
few
patients
receiving
baclofen
:
increased
SGOT
,
elevated
alkaline

and
elevation
of
blood

.
The
adverse
experience
profile
seen
with
KEMSTROTM
was
similar
to
that
seen
with
baclofen
tablets
.
Although
MIVACRON
(
a
mixture
of
three
stereoisomers
)
has
been
administered
safely
following
succinylcholine-facilitated
tracheal
intubation
,
the
interaction

decrease
the

by
as
much
as
25
%
(
see
CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY

.
These
agents
may
also
prolong
the
clinically
effective
duration
of
action
and
decrease
the
average
infusion
requirement
of
MIVACRON
by
as
much
as
35
%
to
40
%
.
A
greater
potentiation
of
the
neuromuscular
blocking
effects
of
MIVACRON
may
be
expected
with
higher
concentrations
of
or
.
Halothane
has
little
or
no
effect
on
the
ED50
,
but
may
prolong
the
duration
of
action
and
decrease
the
average
infusion
requirement
by
as
much
as
20
%
.
Other
which
may
enhance
the
neuromuscular
blocking
action
of
nondepolarizing
agents
such
as
MIVACRON
include
certain
antibiotics
(
e.g.
,
aminoglycosides
,
tetracyclines
,
bacitracin
,
polymyxins
,
,
,
colistin
,
and
sodium
colistimethate
)
,
salts
,
,
local
anesthetics
,
,
and
.
The
neuromuscular
blocking
effect
of
MIVACRON
may
be
enhanced
by
that
reduce
plasma
cholinesterase
activity
(
e.g.
,
chronically
administered
oral
contraceptives
,
glucocorticoids
,
or
certain
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
)
or
by
that
irreversibly
inhibit
plasma
cholinesterase
.
Resistance
to
the
neuromuscular
blocking
action
of
nondepolarizing
neuromuscular
blocking
agents
has
been
demonstrated
in
patients
chronically
administered
or
.
While
the
effects
of
chronic
or
therapy
on
the
action
of
MIVACRON
are
unknown
,
slightly
shorter
durations
of
neuromuscular
block
may
be
anticipated
and
infusion
rate
requirements
may
be
higher

immune
responses
to
inactivated
Newcastle
disease
and
avian
influenza
vaccines
by
oral
administration
of
ginseng
stem-and-leaf
saponins
in
chickens
.
Newcastle
disease
(
ND
)
and
avian
influenza
(
AI
)
are
common
in
the
poultry
industry
.
The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
oral
administration
of
ginseng
stem-and-leaf
saponins
(
GSLS
)
on
the
humoral
immune
responses
of
chickens
to
inactivated
ND
and
AI
vaccines
.
In

of
5
mg/kg
of
BW
for
7
d
on
the
immune
response
in
chickens
intramuscularly
injected
with
inactivated
ND
vaccine
was
evaluated
.
Results
showed
that
GSLS
significantly
increased
the
antibody
level
against
ND
in
the
serum
of
chickens
.
In
experiment
2
,
the
same
regimen
of
GSLS
was
administered
to
chickens
inoculated
with
inactivated
AI
vaccines
,
and
an
enhanced
serum
antibody
response
to
AI
vaccination
was
also
observed
.
Considering
the
safety
of
GSLS
,
because
no
adverse
effect
was
found
throughout
the
experiments
,
GSLS
may
be
a
promising
oral
adjuvant
to
improve
immunization
in
poultry

Diuretics
:
Patients
on
,
and
especially
those
started
recently
,
may
occasionally
experience
an
excessive
reduction
of
blood
pressure
after
initiation
of
ACEON
Tablets
therapy
.
The
possibility
of
hypotensive
effects
can
be
minimized
by
either
discontinuing
the
or
increasing
the
salt
intake
prior
to
initiation
of
treatment
with
perindopril
.
If
can
not
be
interrupted
,
close
medical
supervision
should
be
provided
with
the
first
dose
of
ACEON
Tablets
,
for
at
least
two
hours
and
until
blood
pressure
has
stabilized
for
another
hour
.
The
rate
and
extent
of
perindopril
absorption
and
elimination
are
not
affected
by
concomitant
.
The
bioavailability
of
perindoprilat
was
reduced
by
,
however
,
and
this
was
associated
with
a
decrease
in
plasma
ACE
inhibition
.
Supplements
and
Potassium-Sparing
Diuretics
:
ACEON
Tablets
may
increase
serum
because
of
its
potential
to
decrease
aldosterone
production
.
Use
of
potassium-sparing
(
,
,
and
others
)
,
supplements
or
other
capable
of
increasing
serum
(
,
,
and
others
)
can
increase
the
risk
of
hyperkalemia
.
Therefore
,
if
concomitant
use
of
such
agents
is
indicated
,
they
should
be
given
with
caution
and
the
patient
's
serum
should
be
monitored
frequently
.
:
Increased
serum
and
symptoms
of
toxicity
have
been
reported
in
patients
receiving
concomitant
and
ACE
inhibitor
therapy
.
These
should
be
coadministered
with
caution
and
frequent
monitoring
of
serum
concentration
is
recommended
.
Use
of
a
may
further
increase
the
risk
of
toxicity
.
:
A
controlled
pharmacokinetic
study
has
shown
no
effect
on
plasma
concentrations
when
coadministered
with
ACEON
Tablets
,
but
an
effect
of
on
the
plasma
concentration
of
perindopril/perindoprilat
has
not
been
excluded
.
:
Animal
data
have
suggested
the
possibility
of
interaction
between
perindopril
and
.
However
,
this
has
not
been
investigated
in
human
studies
.
Coadministration
of
both
should
proceed
with
caution
.
Food
Interaction
:
Oral
administration
of
ACEON
Tablets
with
food
does
not
significantly
lower
the
rate
or
extent
of
perindopril
absorption
relative
to
the
fasted
state
.
However
,
the
extent
of
biotransformation
of
perindopril
to
the
active
metabolite
,
perindoprilat
,
is
reduced
approximately
43
%
,
resulting
in
a
reduction
in
the
plasma
ACE
inhibition
curve
of
approximately
20
%
,
probably
clinically
insignificant
.
In
clinical
trials
,
perindopril
was
generally
administered
in
a
non-fasting
state

The
effects
of
concomitant
administration
on
the
steady-state
pharmacokinetics
of
quetiapine
.
Quetiapine
fumarate
(
'Seroquel

)
is
a
newly
introduced
atypical
antipsychotic
with
demonstrated
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
positive
and
negative
symptoms
of
schizophrenia
.
It
is
extensively
metabolized
,
predominantly
by
cytochrome
P450
3A4
.
Therefore
,
concurrent
administration
of
that
induce
or
inhibit
this
enzyme
may
affect
quetiapine
pharmacokinetics
.
This
study
demonstrated
that
the
potent
cytochrome
P450
enzyme-inducer
did
indeed
have
a
marked
effect
on
the
metabolism
of
quetiapine
,
resulting
in
a
5-fold
increase
in
clearance
when
administered
concomitantly
to
patients
with
DSM-IV-diagnosed
schizophrenia
,
schizoaffective
disorder
,
or
bipolar
disorder
.
These
results
indicate
that
dosage
adjustment
of
quetiapine
may
be
necessary
when
the
two
are
given
concurrently
and
that
caution
may
be
required
when
administering
other
that
inhibit
or
induce
cytochromes
,
particularly
P450
3A4
.
Ethopropazine
may
interact
with
or
other
CNS
depressants
,
causing
increased
sedative
effects
.
It
may
also
interact
with

other
anticholinergic
or
MAOIs
,
which
may
intensify
the
anticholinergic
action
.
Ethopropazine

No
evidence
of
interaction
of

disease
.
Cardiovascular
disease
is
a
common
comorbidity
and
a
major
cause
of
mortality
in
patients
with
chronic
renal
disease
.
Drug
regimens
in
patients
with
cardiovascular
disease
are
frequently
complex
and
can
be
significantly
affected
by
alterations
in
renal
function
.
In

affect
renal
function
and
the
management
of
patients

of
cardiovascular
and
identifies
clinically
important
interactions
between
these
and
other
commonly
used
in
the
management
of
chronic
renal

Several
classes
of
cardiovascular
are
also
discussed
in
relationship
to
their
differential
effects
on
the
management

human
heart
.
OBJECTIVES
.
This
study
investigated
the
role
of
neuronal
uptake
of
(
uptake-1
)
in
human
heart
failure
as
a
local
factor
for
altering
concentrations
of

the
cardiac
myocyte
membranes
.
BACKGROUND
.
Several
beta-adrenergic
neuroeffector
defects
occur
in
heart
failure
.
Whether
an
alteration
in
uptake-1
occurs
is
still
unresolved
.
METHODS
.
The
role
of
uptake-1
was
studied
in
electrically
stimulated
(
1
Hz
,
37
degrees

)
human
ventricular
cardiac
preparations
and
isolated
myocardial
membranes
.
RESULTS
.
The
effectiveness
of
in
increasing
the
force
of
contraction
was
decreased
in
relation
to
the
degree
of
heart
failure
.
In
contrast
,
the
potency
of
was
increased
in
failing
hearts
(

class
IV
)
in
relation
to
the
concentrations
producing
50
%
of

CONCLUSIONS
.
In
human
heart
failure
,
there
is
a
presynaptic
defect
in
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
,
leading
to
reduced
uptake-1
activity
.
This
defect
in
the
failing
heart
can
be
mimicked
by
the
effects
of
uptake
blocking
agents
,
such
as
cocaine
and
,
in
the
nonfailing
heart
only
.
Compromised
uptake-1
in
functional
class
IV
can
not
be
further
increased
by
cocaine
and
.
The
pathophysiologic
consequences
could
be
an
increased
synaptic
concentration
of
predisposing
to
adenylyl
cyclase
desensitization
.

.
The
antifungal
drug
,

inhibits
the
growth
of
several
species
of
Candida

Candida
albicans
,
one
of
the

,
was
totally
inhibited
at
a
concentration
of
approximately
10
mug/ml
.
Endogenous
respiration
was
unaffected
by
the
drug
at
a
concentration
as
high
as
100
mug/ml
,
whereas
exogenous
respiration
was
markedly
sensitive
and
inhibited
to
an
extent
of
85
%
.
The
permeability
of
the
cell
membrane
was
changed
as
evidenced
by
the
leakage
of
260-nm
absorbing
materials
,
amino
acids
,
proteins
,
and
inorganic
cations
.
The
results
we
present
clearly
show
that
the
drug
alters
the
cellular

and
thus
the
exogenous

becomes
sensitive
to

Drug
Interactions
:
Inhibitors
of
Isozymes
:
Caution
is
advised
when
is
administered
concomitantly
with
that
are
known
to
inhibit
the
cytochrome
P450
3A4
enzyme
system
(
ie
,
some
in
the
drug
classes
of
azole
antimycotics
,
protease
inhibitors
,
channel
antagonists
,
and
macrolide
antibiotics
)
.
Drugs
such
as
,
,
,
,
and
were
shown
to
significantly
increase
the
C
max
and
AUC
of
orally
administered
.
These
drug
interactions
may
result
in
increased
and
prolonged
sedation
due
to
a
decrease
in
plasma
clearance
of
.
Although
not
studied
,
the
potent
cytochrome
P450
3A4
inhibitors
and
may
cause
intense
and
prolonged
sedation
and
respiratory
depression
due
to
a
decrease
in
plasma
clearance
of
.
Caution
is
advised
when
VERSED
Syrup
is
used
concomitantly
with
these
.
Dose
adjustments
should
be
considered
and
possible
prolongation
and
intensity
of
effect
should
be
anticipated
.
Inducers
of
Isozymes
:
Cytochrome
P450
inducers
,
such
as
,
,
and
,
induce
metabolism
and
caused
a
markedly
decreased
C
max
and
AUC
of
oral
in
adult
studies
.
Although
clinical
studies
have
not
been
performed
,
is
expected
to
have
the
same
effect
.
Caution
is
advised
when
administering
VERSED
Syrup
to
patients
receiving
these
medications
and
if
necessary
dose
adjustments
should
be
considered
.
The
difficulty
in
achieving
adequate
sedation
may
have
been
the
result
of
decreased
absorption
of
the
sedatives
due
to
both
the
gastrointestinal
effects
and
stimulant
effects
of
methylphenidate
.
The
sedative
effect
of
VERSED
Syrup
is
accentuated
by
any
concomitantly
administered
medication
which
depresses
the
central
nervous
system
,
particularly
narcotics
(
eg
,
,
and
)
,
,
,
nitrous
oxide
,
secobarbital
and
.
Consequently
,
the
dose
of
VERSED
Syrup
should
be
adjusted
according
to
the
type
and
amount
of
concomitant
medications
administered
and
the
desired
clinical
response
.
No
significant
adverse
interactions
with
common
premedications
(
such
as
,
scopolamine
,
glycopyrrolate
,
,
,
and
other
muscle
relaxants
)
or
local
anesthetics
have
been
observed
.
The
concomitant
use
of
Sanctura
with
other
anticholinergic
agents
that
produce
dry
mouth
,
constipation
,
and
other
anticholinergic
pharmacological
effects
may
increase
the
frequency
and/or
severity
of
such
effects
.
Anticholinergic
agents
may
potentially
alter
the
absorption
of
some
concomitantly
administered
due
to
anticholinergic
effects
on
gastrointestinal
motility
.
Drugs
Eliminated
by
Active
Tubular
Secretion
:
Although
studies
to
assess
drug-drug
interactions
with
Sanctura
have
not
been
conducted
,
Sanctura
has
the
potential
for
pharmacokinetic
interactions
with
other
that
are
eliminated
by
active
tubular
secretion
(
e.g
.
,
,
pancuronium
,
,
vancomycin
,
and
tenofovir
)
.
Coadministration
of
Sanctura
with
that
are
eliminated
by
active
renal
tubular
secretion
may
increase
the
serum
concentration
of
Sanctura
and/or
the
coadministered
drug
due
to
competition
for
this
elimination
pathway
.
Careful
patient
monitoring

,
any
other

.
Netilmicin
should
not
be
administered
concomitantly
with
potent

the
potential
for
ototoxicity

Theoretically
,
the

failed
to
show
that
taking
the

The
effects
of
ruthenium
red
(
RR
)
on
inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate
(
InsP
(

)
)
-induced
responses
were
studied
in
rat
bone
marrow
megakaryocytes
with
the
patch-clamp
whole-cell
recording
technique
in
combination
with
fura-2
microfluorometry
.
Internal
application
of
InsP
(
3
)
(
100
microM
)
increased
intracellular
Ca
(
2+
)
concentration
(
[

]
(
i
)
)
and
activated
the
Ca
(

-dependent
K
(
+
)
current
.
Administering
InsP
(
3
)
together
with
RR
(
100-500
microM
)
inhibited
InsP
(
3
)
-induced
responses
(
both
Ca
(
2+

and
current
responses
)
in
a
dose-dependent
fashion
.
Pretreatment
of
megakaryocytes
with
extracellular
RR
(
50
microM
)
also
inhibited
InsP
(
3
)
-induced
responses
.
Intracellular
and
extracellular
application
of
RR
reduced
ADP-induced
increases
in
[
Ca
(

]
(

)
.
In
contrast
,
in
isolated
single
pancreatic
acinar
cells
,
RR
had
no
effect
on
InsP
(
3
)
-induced
responses
.
Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
site
of
the
inhibitory
action
of
RR
is
at
the
InsP
(
3
)
,
or
its
closely
associated
proteins
.
In
addition
,
we
have
shown
that
RR
is
a
useful
pharmacological
tool
with
which
to
examine
the
InsP

-mediated
responses
of
megakaryocytes

response
is
due

Phencyclidine

affect
its
clinical
activity

In

studies
indicate
that
bupropion

primarily
metabolized
to
hydroxybupropion
by
the
CYP2B6
isoenzyme
.
Therefore
,
the
potential
exists
for
a
drug
interaction
between
WELLBUTRIN
and
that
affect

CYP2B6
isoenzyme
(
e.g.

The
threohydrobupropion
metabolite
of
bupropion
does
not

increases
in

While
not

studied
,
certain
may
induce
the
metabolism
of
bupropion
(
e.g.
,
,
,
)
.
Animal
data
indicated
that
bupropion
may
be
an
inducer
of
drug-metabolizing
enzymes
in
humans
.
In

,
following
chronic
administration
of
bupropion
,
100
mg
3
times
daily
to
8
healthy
male
volunteers
for
14
days
,
there
was
no
evidence
of
induction
of
its
own
metabolism
.
Nevertheless

there
may
be
the
potential
for

Drug-drug
interactions
with
Mefloquine
have
not
been
explored
in
detail
.
There
is
one
report
of
cardiopulmonary
arrest
,
with
full
recovery
,
in
a
patient
who
was
taking
a
beta
blocker
(
)
.
The
effects
of
Mefloquineuine
on
the
compromised
cardiovascular
system
have
not
been
evaluated
.
The
benefits
of
Mefloquine
therapy
should
be
weighed
against
the
possibility
of
adverse
effects
in
patients
with
cardiac
disease
.
Because
of
the
danger
of
a
potentially
fatal
prolongation
of
the
QTc
interval
,
halofantrine
must
not
be
given
simultaneously
with
or
subsequent
to
Mefloquine
.
Concomitant
administration
of
Mefloquine
and
other
related
compounds
(
eg
,
,
and
)
may
produce
electrocardiographic
abnormalities
and
increase
the
risk
of
convulsions
.
If
these
are
to
be
used
in
the
initial
treatment
of
severe
malaria
,
Mefloquine
administration
should
be
delayed
at
least
12
hours
after
the
last
dose
.
There
is
evidence
that
the
use
of
halofantrine
after
Mefloquineuine
causes
a
significant
lengthening
of
the
QTc
interval
.
Clinically
significant
QTc
prolongation
has
not
been
found
with
Mefloquineuine
alone
.
This
appears
to
be
the
only
clinically
relevant
interaction
of
this
kind
with
Mefloquine
,
although
theoretically
,
coadministration
of
other
known
to
alter
cardiac
conduction
(
eg
,
anti-arrhythmic
or
beta-adrenergic
blocking
agents
,
channel
blockers
,
or
H1-blocking
agents
,
tricyclic
antidepressants
and
phenothiazines
)
might
also
contribute
to
a
prolongation
of
the
QTc
interval
.
There
are
no
data
that
conclusively
establish
whether
the
concomitant
administration
of
Mefloquineuine
and
the
above
listed
agents
has
an
effect
on
cardiac
function
.
In
patients
taking
an
anticonvulsant
(
eg
,
valproic
acid
,
,
or
)
,
the
concomitant
use
of
Mefloquine
may
reduce
seizure
control
by
lowering
the
plasma
levels
of
the
anticonvulsant
.
Therefore
,
patients
concurrently
taking
antiseizure
medication
and
Mefloquine
should
have
the
blood
level
of
their
antiseizure
medication
monitored
and
the
dosage
adjusted
appropriately
.
When
Mefloquine
is
taken
concurrently
with
oral
live
typhoid
vaccines
,
attenuation
of
immunization
can
not
be
excluded
.
Vaccinations
with
attenuated
live
bacteria
should
therefore
be
completed
at
least
3
days
before
the
first
dose
of
Mefloquine
.
No
other
drug
interactions
are
known
.
Nevertheless
,
the
effects
of
Mefloquine
on
travelers
receiving
comedication
,
particularly
diabetics
or
patients
using
anticoagulants
,
should
be
checked
before
departure

the
concomitant
administration
of

Acute
effect
of
different
antidepressants
on
glycemia
in
diabetic
and
non-diabetic
rats
.
Diabetic
patients
have
a
20
%
higher
risk
of
depression
than
the
general
population
.
Treatment
with
antidepressant
can
directly
interfere
with
blood
levels
or
may
interact
with
hypoglycemic
agents
.
The
treatment
of
depression
in
diabetic
patients
must
take
into
account
variations
of
glycemic
levels
at
different
times
and
a
comparison
of
the
available
antidepressant
agents
is
important
.
In
the
present
study
we
evaluated
the
interference
of
antidepressants
with
blood
levels
of
diabetic
and
non-diabetic
rats
.
In
a
first
experiment
,
male
adult
Wistar

were
fasted
for
12

.
Imipramine
(
5

0.25
mg/kg
)
,
(
20
mg/kg
)
(
30
mg/kg
)
or

was
administered
.
After
30
min
,
fasting
glycemia
was
measured
.
An
oral
overload
of
1
ml
of
a
50
%
solution
was
given
to
rats
and
blood
was
determined
after
30
,
60
and
90
min
.
Imipramine
and
clonazepam
did
not
change
fasting
or
overload
glycemia
.
and
moclobemide
increased
blood
at
different
times
after
the
overload
.
neutralized
the
increase
of
glycemia
induced
by
oral
overload
.
In
the
second
experiment
,
non-diabetic
and
streptozotocin-induced
diabetic
rats
were
fasted
,
and
the
same
procedures
were
followed
for
estimation
of
tolerance
30
min
after
overload
.
Again
,
neutralized
the
increase
in
glycemia
after
overload
both
in
diabetic
and
non-diabetic
rats
.
These
data
raise
the
question
of
whether
is
the
best
choice
for
prolonged
use
for
diabetic
individuals
,
because
of
its
antihyperglycemic
effects
.
Clonazepam
would
be
useful
in
cases
with
potential
risk
of
hypoglycemia
.

have
been
no

Excretion
of
thioethers
in
urine
after
exposure
to
electrophilic
chemicals
.
Electrophilic
agents
--
a
class
of
chemicals
that
includes
most
genotoxic
compounds
--
can
be
inactivated
by
reaction
with
glutathione
or
other
SH-bearing
molecules
.
The
conjugates
so
formed
often
appear
in
the
urine
as
mercapturic
acids
or
other
thioether
products
.
This
paper
critically
reviews
the
suitability
of
the
urinary
thioether
assay
as
a
method
for
the
detection
of
exposure
to
electrophilic
agents
or
their
precursors
.
In
practice
,
the
greatest
value
of
the
thioether
assay
appears
to
lie
in
its
signal
function
.
This
is
demonstrated
for
cigarette
smokers
and
industrial
workers
involved
in
chemical
waste
incineration
.
Whenever
increased
thioether
excretion
is
observed
,
it
is
likely
to
be
due
to
exposure
to
one
or
more
suspect
compounds
.
However
,
when
the
thioether
concentration
ranges
within
the
limits
of
the
normal
value
,
one
must
not
conclude
that
there
is
no
,
or
negligible
,
exposure
.
More
specific
applications
of
the
assay
of
thio
compounds
in
urine
allow
development
of
selective
methods
that
may
be
useful
for

increases
the
clearance
of
busulfan
by
15
%
or
more
,
possibly
due
to
the
induction
of

Since
the
pharmacokinetics
of
BUSULFEX
were
studied
in
patients
treated
with

the
clearance
of
BUSULFEX
at
the
recommended
dose
may
be
lower
and
exposure
(
AUC
)
higher
in
patients
not
treated

Because
busulfan

the
body
via
conjugation
with
glutathione
,
use
of
prior
to

result
in
reduced

Ephedrine
:
Ephedrine
may
enhance
the

Vaccines
:
Patients
on
therapy
may
exhibit
a
diminished
response
to
toxoids
and
live

exposure
in
mice
selectively

sensitivity
to

Mice
from
the
20th
generation
of
three
lines
divergently
selected
for
response
to
pentobarbital-induced
sedation
times
[
long-sedation
time
(
LST
)
,
short
sedation
time
(
SST
)
,
and
randomly
bred
control
(
RBC
)
]
were
used
to
study
cocaine-induced
behavioral
sensitization
.
These
lines
showed
variable
degrees
of
locomotor
activities
in
response
to
cocaine
.
At
a
low
cocaine
dose
and
long
withdrawal
period
(
10
mg/kg
,
twice
a
day
for
5
days
followed
by
a
14-day
withdrawal
)
,
the
LST
mice
showed
tolerance
development
.
In
response
to
cocaine
,
the
locomotor
activities
of
the
SST
were
not
significantly
different
from
the
RBC
group
.
At
a
higher
dose
and
a
shorter
withdrawal
period
(
20
mg/kg
,
daily
for
7
days
followed
by
a
3-day
withdrawal
)
,
the
SST
mice
showed
behavioral
sensitization
similar
to
the
RBC
mice
,
but
the
LST
mice
did
not
develop
sensitization
.
The
different
responses
in
locomotor
activity
induced
by
cocaine
suggest
that
genetic
factors
may
play
a
role
in
determining
the
magnitude
of
response
to
this
drug
.
Dopamine
(
DA
)
levels
did
not
differ
significantly
in
either
striatum
(
STR
)
or
nucleus
accumbens
(
NAC
)
for
the
cocaine-treated
animals
to
their
corresponding
saline-treated
controls
.
The
affinity
(
Kd
)
of
D2
in
the
NAC
decreased
significantly
,
without
changes
in
density
(
Bmax
)
,
in
the
cocaine-treated
SST
and
RBC
mice
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
density
of
D2
binding
sites
in
the
SST
and
the
RBC
mice
in
the
STR
was
significantly
increased
in
cocaine-treated
groups
without

in
Kd
.
The
LST
mice
did
not
show
any
changes
in
the
Kd
and
Bmax
in
either
the
STR
or
the
NAC
.
Taken
together
,
these
findings
suggest
that
the
changes
in
the
Kd
of
D2
in
the
NAC
and
the
Bmax
of
D2
in
the
STR
may
contribute
to
the
differences
in
locomotor
responses
to

Effect
of
on
endotoxin-induced
changes
in
steroid
hormone
levels
and
lethality
in
male
rats
.
We
examined
the
effect
of
exogenous
on
the
changes
in
serum
steroid
hormone
levels
induced
by
a
nonlethal
dose
of
Escherichia
coli
endotoxin
in
male
rats
and
the
deaths
due
to
nonlethal
and
lethal
doses
of
endotoxin
.
Injection
of
5
min
before
a
nonlethal
dose
of
endotoxin
changed
the
serum
sex
steroid
hormone
response
of
male
rats
to
endotoxin
.
The
serum
estrogen
concentrations
of
+
endotoxin-treated
rats
decreased
by
50
%
,
while
those
of
the
endotoxin-treated
rats
increased
(
2-
to
5-fold
)
.
The
serum
androgen
concentrations
of
+
endotoxin-treated
rats
did
not
change
significantly
,
while
those
of
endotoxin-treated
rats
dropped
to
30-40
%
0.001
.
Exogenous
also
appeared
to
influence
the
percentage
of
endotoxin-induced
deaths
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.
It
reduced
the
number
of
deaths
induced
by
nonlethal
(
2
mg/kg
)
dose
of
endotoxin
but
increased
the
number
of
deaths
induced
by
a
highly
lethal
dose
(
8
mg/kg
)
.
These
results
,
together
with
the
known
relationships
between
estrogen
and
the
immune
response
,
suggest
that
estrogens
affect
the
course
of
septic
shock
in
a
complex
fashion
and
may
have
either
protective
or
deleterious
effect
.

.
Since
its
introduction
in
1999
,
Implanon
remains
one
of
the
preferred
contraceptive
choices
for
many
women
as
it
offers
a
highly
effective
means
of
long-term
contraception
for
three
years
that

not
rely
on

.
Like
all
hormonal
contraceptives
,
certain
hepatic

We
present
an
interesting
case
of

on
two
separate
occasions
with

,
the
administration
of
TORADOL

ACE
Inhibitors
:
Concomitant
use
of
ACE

may
increase
the
risk
of
renal

,
particularly
in
volume-depleted
patients

Antiepileptic
Drugs
:
Sporadic
cases

Prevention
of
emergence
agitation
in
seven
children
receiving
low-dose
and
total
intravenous
.
Emergence
agitation
(
EA
)
can
be
a
distressing
side
effect
of
pediatric
.
We
retrospectively
reviewed
the
records
of
7
pediatric
oncology
patients
who
received
low-dose
in
conjunction
with
for
total
intravenous
(
TIVA
)
repeatedly
for
radiation
therapy
.
EA
signs
were
observed
in
all
7
patients
in
association
with
TIVA
but
did
not
recur
in
any
of
123
subsequent
anesthetics
sessions
during
which
low-dose
was
added
to
.
Based
on
this
experience
,
we
suggest
that
low-dose
added
to
may
be
associated
with
prevention
of
EA
in
children
with
a
history
of
EA
with
TIVA
.
If
additional
adrenergic
are
to
be
administered
by
any
route
,
they
should
be
used
with
caution
because
the
pharmacologically
predictable
sympathetic
effects
of
BROVANA
may
be
potentiated
.
When
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of

was
co-administered
with
BROVANA
at
steady-state
,
exposure
to
either
drug
was
not
altered
.
Dosage
adjustments
of
BROVANA
are
not
necessary
when
the
drug
is
given
concomitantly
with
potent
inhibitors
.
Concomitant
treatment
with
methylxanthines
(
,
)
,
steroids
,
or
may
potentiate
any
hypokalemic
effect
of
adrenergic
agonists
.
The
ECG
changes
and/or
hypokalemia
that
may
result
from
the
administration
of
non-potassium
sparing
(
such
as
loop
or
thiazide
)
can
be
acutely
worsened
by
beta-agonists
,
especially
when
the
recommended
dose
of
the
beta-agonist
is
exceeded
.
Although
the
clinical
significance
of
these

Increased

We
obtained
evidence
that
increased
stability
of
nucleophosmin/B23
is
involved
in
antiapoptotic
effect
of
ras
during
serum
deprivation
.
Nucleophosmin/B23
in
serum-deprived
(
0
%
serum
)
NIH-3T3
cells
was
found
to
be
highly
unstable
with
a
half-life
less
than
4
h
.
In
contrast
,
nucleophosmin/B23
in
serum-deprived
ras-transformed
(
RAS-3T3
)
cells
was
as
stable
as
that
in
serum-supplemented
NIH-3T3
or
RAS-3T3
cells
.
Treatment
of
RAS-3T3
cells
with
nucleophosmin/B23
antisense
oligomer
significantly
potentiated
the
apoptosis
induced
by
serum
deprivation
.
Much
less
caspase-3
activity
was
noted
in
the
lysate
derived
from
serum-deprived
RAS-3T3
cells
compared
with
that
in
the
lysate
of
serum-deprived
NIH-3T3
cells
.
Cell
permeable
caspase-3
inhibitor
added
in
the
medium
blocked
the
decrease
of
nucleophosmin/B23
and
apoptosis
induced
by
serum
deprivation
in
NIH-3T3
cells
.
The
inhibitor
,
on
the
other
hand
,
promoted
significant
decrease
of
nucleolin/C23
in
NIH-3T3
cells
during
serum
deprivation
.
Unlike
nucleolin/C23
,
down-regulation
of
nucleophosmin/B23
was
thus
not
proliferation-dependent
but
caspase-3-
and
apoptosis-dependent
.
Our

the
co-administration
of
lisinopril

are
usually
reversible
.
Reports
suggest
that
NSAIDs
may
diminish
the
antihypertensive

,
including
lisinopril
.
This
interaction
should
be
given
consideration
in
patients
taking
NSAIDs
concomitantly

Jacalin
:
an
IgA-binding
lectin
.
We
previously
reported
that
seeds
of
Artocarpus
integrifolia
(
jackfruit
)
contain
a
lectin
,
which
we
call
jacalin
,
that
is
both
a
potent
T
cell
mitogen
and
an
apparently
T
cell-independent
activator
of
human
B
cells
for
the
secretion
of
immunoglobulins
.
During
the
above
experiments
we
noted
a
massive
precipitation
in
cell
cultures
stimulated
with
greater
than
or
equal
to
100
micrograms
of
lectin
.
In
this
paper
,
we
show
that
the
precipitate
is
formed
after
the
interaction
of
jacalin
and
the
serum
protein
added
to
the
culture
medium
.
More
importantly
,
we
demonstrate
that
IgA
is
probably
the
major
serum
constituent
precipitated
by
the
lectin
and
that
no
IgG
or
IgM
can
be
detected
in
the
precipitates
.
In
secretions
such
as
colostrum
,
IgA
is
the
only
protein
precipitated
by
jacalin
.
On
the
basis
of
this
specificity
we
describe
a
simple
and
reliable
affinity
chromatography
procedure
for
the
purification
of
both
human
serum
and
colostrum
IgA
.
Jacalin

a
D-Gal
binding
lectin

should
be
a
useful

10
%
of

so
called

prevalence
of

.
Poor
metabolizers
have
higher
than
expected
plasma
concentrations
of

(
TCAs
)
when
given

doses
.
Depending
on
the
traction
of

the

,
they
may
vary
in
the
extent
of
inhibition
.
The
extent
to
which

interactions
may
pose
clinical
problems
will
depend
on
the
degree
of

and
the

also
in

must
elapse

the
long
half-life

Concomitant
use
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
with

P450
2D6
may
require
lower
doses
than

or
the

.
Furthermore
,
whenever
one
of
these
other
is
withdrawn
from
co-therapy
,
an
increased
dose
of
tricyclic
antidepressant
may
be
required
.
It
is
desirable
to
monitor
TCA
plasma
levels
whenever

Olanzapine
:
an
updated
review
of
its
use
in
the
management
of
schizophrenia
.
Olanzapine
,
a
thienobenzodiazepine
derivative
,
is
a
second
generation
(
atypical
)
antipsychotic
agent
which
has
proven
efficacy
against
the
positive
and
negative
symptoms
of
schizophrenia
.
Compared
with
conventional
antipsychotics
,
it
has
greater
affinity
for
serotonin
5-HT2A
than
for
D2
receptors
.
In
large
,
well
controlled
trials
in
patients
with
schizophrenia
or
related
psychoses
,
olanzapine
5
to
20
mg/day
was
significantly
superior
to
5
to
20
mg/day
in
overall
improvements
in
psychopathology
rating
scales
and
in
the
treatment
of
depressive
and
negative
symptoms
,
and
was
comparable
in
effects
on
positive
psychotic
symptoms
.
The
1-year
risk
of
relapse
(
rehospitalisation
)
was
significantly
lower
with
olanzapine
than
with
treatment
.
In
the
first
double-blind
comparative
study
(
28-week
)
of
olanzapine
and
risperidone
,
olanzapine
10
to
20
mg/day
proved
to
be
significantly
more
effective
than
risperidone
4
to
12
mg/day
in
the
treatment
of
negative
and
depressive
symptoms
but
not
on
overall
psychopathology
symptoms
.
In
contrast
,
preliminary
results
from
an
8-week
controlled
study
suggested
risperidone
2
to
6
mg/day
was
superior
to
olanzapine
5
to
20
mg/day
against
positive
and
anxiety/depressive
symptoms
(
p
<
0.05
)
,
although
consistent
with
the
first
study
,
both
agents
demonstrated
similar
efficacy
on
measures
of
overall
psychopathology
.
Improvements
in
general
cognitive
function
seen
with
olanzapine
treatment
in
a
1-year
controlled
study
of
patients
with
early-phase
schizophrenia
,
were
significantly
greater
than
changes
seen
with
either
risperidone
or
.
However
,
preliminary
results
from
an
8-week
trial
showed
comparable
cognitive
enhancing
effects
of
olanzapine
and
risperidone
treatment
in
patients
with
schizophrenia
or
schizoaffective
disorder
.
Several
studies
indicate
that
olanzapine
has
benefits
against
symptoms
of
aggression
and
agitation
,
while
other
studies
strongly
support
the
effectiveness
of
olanzapine
in
the
treatment
of
depressive
symptomatology
.
Olanzapine
is
associated
with
significantly
fewer
extrapyramidal
symptoms
than
and
risperidone
.
In
addition
,
olanzapine
is
not
associated
with
a
risk
of
agranulocytosis
as
seen
with
or
clinically
significant
hyperprolactinaemia
as
seen
with
risperidone
or
prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
.
The
most
common
adverse
effects
reported
with
olanzapine
are
bodyweight
gain
,
somnolence
,
dizziness
,
anticholinergic
effects
(
constipation
and
dry
mouth
)
and
transient
asymptomatic
liver
enzyme
elevations
.
In
comparison
with
,
the
adverse
events
reported
significantly
more
frequently
with
olanzapine
in
>
or
=
3.5
%
of
patients
were
dry
mouth
,
bodyweight
gain
and
increased
appetite
and
compared
with
risperidone
,
only
bodyweight
gain
occurred
significantly
more
frequently
with
olanzapine
.
The
high
acquisition
cost
of
olanzapine
is
offset
by
reductions
in
other
treatment
costs
(
inpatient
and/or
outpatient
services
)
of
schizophrenia
.
Pharmacoeconomic
analyses
indicate
that
olanzapine
does
not
significantly
increase
,
and
may
even
decrease
,
the
overall
direct
treatment
costs
of
schizophrenia
,
compared
with
.
Compared
with
risperidone
,
olanzapine
has
also
been
reported
to
decrease
overall
treatment
costs
,
despite
the
several-fold
higher
daily
acquisition
cost
of
the
drug
.
Olanzapine
treatment
improves
quality
of
life
in
patients
with
schizophrenia
and
related
psychoses
to
a
greater
extent
than
,
and
to
broadly
the
same
extent
as
risperidone
.
CONCLUSIONS
:
Olanzapine
demonstrated
superior
antipsychotic
efficacy
compared
with
in
the
treatment
of
acute
phase
schizophrenia
,
and
in
the
treatment
of
some
patients
with
first-episode
or
treatment-resistant
schizophrenia
.
The
reduced
risk
of
adverse
events
and
therapeutic
superiority
compared
with
and
risperidone
in
the
treatment
of
negative
and
depressive
symptoms
support
the
choice
of
olanzapine
as
a
first-line
option
in
the
management
of
schizophrenia
in
the
acute
phase
and
for
the
maintenance
of
treatment
response
.

Death
in
users
:
causes
and
rates
.
The
world
medical
literature
contains
43
reports
of
deaths
associated
with
amphetamines
in
a
35-year
period
.
These
included
seven
cerebrovascular
accidents
,
six
sudden
cardiac
deaths
,
three
cases
of
hyperpyrexia
,
eight
poisonings
of
uncertain
mechanism
and
seven
cases
of
medical
complications
of
intravenous
injection
;
the
remainder
were
of
uncertain
cause
.
In
contrast
,
in
Ontario
alone
,
in
1972
and
1973
there
were
26
deaths
in
users
,
of
which
16
were
due
to
accident
suicide
or
homicide
.
Of
the
remaining
cases
,
two
were
cardiac
,
two
hepatic
and
the
rest
were
mixed
drug
overdose
.
Pulmonary
granulomata
,
subacute
hepatitis
and
other
lesions
resulting
from
intravenous
drug
use
were
common
findings
at
autopsy
.
On
the
basis
of
the
estimated
number
of
regular
users
of
intravenous
in
Ontario
,
the
mortality
rate
in
such
users
is
at
least
four
times
as
high
as
in
the
general
population
of
the
same
age
,
and
is
comparable
to
that
in
alcoholics
and
addicts
.
However
,
the
absolute
number
of
alcohol-related
deaths
is
far
greater
than
the
number
of
deaths
in
or
users
.
The
concomitant
use
of
oxybutynin
with
other
anticholinergic
or
with
other
agents
which
produce
dry
mouth
,
constipation
,
somnolence
(
drowsiness
)
,
and/or
other
anticholinergic-like
effects
may
increase
the
frequency
and/or
severity
of
such
effects
.
Anticholinergic
agents
may
potentially
alter
the
absorption
of
some
concomitantly
administered
due
to
anticholinergic
effects
on
gastrointestinal
motility
.
This
may
be
of
concern
for
with
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
.
Mean
oxybutynin
chloride
plasma
concentrations
were
approximately
2
fold
higher
when
DITROPAN
XL
was
administered
with
,
a
potent
inhibitor
.
Other
inhibitors
of
the
cytochrome
P450
3A4
enzyme
system
,
such
as
antimycotic
agents
(
e.g.
,
and
)
or
macrolide
antibiotics
(
e.g.
,
and
)
,
may
alter
oxybutynin
mean
pharmacokinetic
parameters
(
i.e.
,
Cmax
and
AUC
)
.
The
clinical
relevance
of
such
potential
interactions
is
not
known
.
Caution
should
be
used
when
such
are
co-administered
.
Concurrent
ingestion
of
antacid
(
20
mL
of
antacid
containing
hydroxide
,
hydroxide
,
and
simethicone
)
did
not
significantly
affect
the
exposure
of

.
Substances
that
are
inducers
of
activity

the
metabolism
of
gefitinib

concentrations
.
In
patients
receiving
a
potent
inducer
such
as
or
,
a
dose
increase
to
500
mg
daily
should
be
considered
in
the
absence
of
severe
adverse
drug
reaction
,
and
clinical
response
and
adverse
events
should
be
carefully
monitored
(

.
International
Normalized
Ratio
(
INR
)
elevations
and/or
bleeding
events
have
been
reported
in
some
patients
taking
while
on
IRESSA
therapy
.
Patients
taking
should
be
monitored
regularly
for
changes
in
prothrombin
time
or
INR
.
Substances
that
are
potent
inhibitors
of
activity
(
eg
,
and
)
decrease
gefitinib
metabolism
and
increase
gefitinib
plasma
concentrations
.
This
increase
may
be
clinically
relevant
as
adverse
experiences
are
related
to
dose
and
exposure
;
therefore
,
caution
should
be
used
when
administering
inhibitors
with
IRESSA
.
Drugs
that
cause
significant
sustained
elevation
in
gastric
pH
(
H2-receptor
antagonists
such
as
or
)
may
reduce
plasma
concentrations
of
IRESSA
and
therefore
potentially
may
reduce
efficacy
.
Phase
II
clinical
trial
data
,
where
IRESSA
and
vinorelbine
have
been
used
concomitantly
,
indicate
that
IRESSA
may
exacerbate
the
neutropenic
effect
of
vinorelbine
.
Altered
responsiveness
to
after
exposure
to
organic
lead
.
Ethyl
is
known
to
effect
the
functional
integrity
of
the
limbic
system
,
particularly
the
hippocampus
,
and
to
alter
behaviors
which
are
thought
to
be
mediated
through
limbic
function
.
Organometals
also
compromise
the
limbic
system
and
result
in
deficits
in
learning
and
memory
.
Since
both
and
organoleads
are
present
in
the
environment
and
seem
to
influence
limbic
integration
,
the
interaction
of
these
two
compounds
was
assessed
in
the
present
experiment
.
Thirty
male
rats
of
the
Fischer-344
strain
were
divided
into
three
equal
groups
and
were
given
injections
of
trimethyl
lead
(
TML
)
(
8.0
or
17.0
mg/kg/ml
SC
)
or
the
saline
vehicle
.
Fourteen
days
later
,
all
animals
were
challenged
with
a
single
hypnotic
dose
of
(
3.5
g/kg
IP
)
.
The
20
%
v/v
solution
of
was
prepared
in
water
from
a
stock
solution
of
95
%
.
The
latency
to
loss
of
the
righting
reflex
and
duration
of
sleep
time
were
recorded
while
the
rats
were
kept
in
sound-attenuating
chambers
.
The
rats
treated
with
the
highest
dose
of
TML
manifested
significantly
longer
latencies
to
lose
the
righting
reflex
and
shorter
durations
of
sleep
than
did
controls
.
These
results
suggest
that
exposure
to
environmental
lead
may
alter
the
biological
and
behavioral
responsiveness
of
an
animal
to

Antimicrobial
activity
of
Ganoderma

extract
alone
and
in

Antimicrobial
activity
of
GL
(
the
aqueous
extract
from
the
carpophores
of
Ganoderma
lucidum
(

)
KARST
)
was
tested
in
vitro
against
Gram
positive
and
Gram
negative
bacteria
by
serial
broth
dilution
method
,
and
the
antimicrobial
activity
was
expressed
by
minimal
inhibitory
concentration
(
MIC
)
.
Among
fifteen
species
of
bacteria
tested
,
the
antimicrobial
activity
of
GL
was
the
most
potent
against
Micrococcus
luteus
(
MIC

To
investigate
the
effects
of
antimicrobial
combinations
of
GL
with
four
kinds
of
antibiotics
(
,
cefazolin

oxytetracycline
and
)
,
the
fractional
inhibitory
concentration
index
(
FICI
)
was
determined
by
checkerboard
assay
for
each
strain
.
The
antimicrobial
combinations
of
GL
with
four
antibiotics
resulted
in
additive
effect
in
most
instances
,
synergism
in
two
instances
,
and
antagonism
in

Synergism
was
observed
when
GL
was
combined

Soriatane
is
recommended
.
Hormonal
Contraceptives
:
It
has
not
been
established
if
there
is
a
pharmacokinetic
interaction
between
acitretin
and
combined
oral
contraceptives
.
However
,
it
has
been
established
that
acitretin
interferes
with
the
contraceptive
effect
of
microdosed
progestin
minipill
preparations
.
Microdosed
minipill
progestin
preparations
are
not
recommended
for
use
with
Soriatane
.
It
is
not
known
whether
other
progestational
contraceptives
,
such
as
implants
and
injectables
,
are
adequate
methods
of
contraception
during
acitretin
therapy
.
:
An
increased
risk
of
hepatitis
has
been
reported
to
result
from
combined
use
of
and
etretinate
.
Consequently
,
the
combination
of
with
acitretin
is
also
contraindicated
.
:
If
acitretin
is
given
concurrently
with
,
the
protein
binding
of
may
be
reduced
.
Tetracyclines
:
Since
both
acitretin
and
tetracyclines
can
cause
increased
intracranial
pressure
,
their
combined
use
is
contraindicated
.
Vitamin
A
and
oral
retinoids
:
Concomitant
administration
of
vitamin
A
and/or
other
oral
retinoids
with
acitretin
must
be
avoided
because
of
the
risk
of
hypervitaminosis
A
.
Other
:
There
appears
to
be
no
pharmacokinetic
interaction
between
acitretin
and
,
,
or
.
Investigations
into
the
effect
of
acitretin
on
the
protein
binding
of
anticoagulants
of
the
coumarin
type
(
)
revealed
no
interaction
.
Laboratory
Tests
If
significant
abnormal
laboratory
results
are
obtained
,
either
dosage
reduction
with
careful
monitoring
or
treatment
discontinuation
is
recommended
,
depending
on
clinical
judgement
.
Blood
Sugar
:
Some
patients
receiving
retinoids
have
experienced
problems
with
blood
sugar
control
.
In
addition
,
new
cases
of
diabetes
have
been
diagnosed
during
retinoid
therapy
,
including
diabetic
ketoacidosis
.
In
diabetics
,
blood-sugar
levels
should
be
monitored
very
carefully
.
Lipids
:
In
clinical
studies
,
the
incidence
of
hypertriglyceridemia
was
66
%
,
hypercholesterolemia
was
33
%
and
that
of
decreased
HDL
was
40
%
.
Pretreatment
and
follow-up
measurements
should
be
obtained
under
fasting
conditions
.
It
is
recommended
that
these
tests
be
performed
weekly
or
every
other
week
until
the
lipid
response
to
Soriatane
has
stabilized
.
Liver
Function
Tests
:
Elevations
of
AST
(
SGOT
)
,
ALT
(
SGPT
)
or
LDH
were
experienced
by
approximately
1
in
3
patients
treated
with
Soriatane
.
It
is
recommended
that
these
tests
be
performed
prior
to
initiation
of
Soriatane
therapy
,
at
1-
to
2-week
intervals
until
stable
and
thereafter
at
intervals
as
clinically
indicated
.
ZEBETA
should
not
be
combined
with
other
agents
.
Patients
receiving
catecholamine-depleting
,
such
as
or
,
should
be
closely
monitored
,
because
the
added
beta-adrenergic
blocking
action
of
ZEBETA
may
produce
excessive
reduction
of
sympathetic
activity
.
In
patients
receiving
concurrent
therapy
with
,
if
therapy
is
to
be
discontinued
,
it
is
suggested
that
ZEBETA
be
discontinued
for
several
days
before
the
withdrawal
of
.
ZEBETA
should
be
used
with
care
when
myocardial
depressants
or
inhibitors
of
AV
conduction
,
such
as
certain
antagonists
(
particularly
of
the
phenylalkylamine
[
]
and
benzothiazepine
[
]
classes
)
,
or
agents
,
such
as
,
are
used
concurrently
.
Concurrent
use
of
increases
the
metabolic
clearance
of
ZEBETA
,
resulting
in
a
shortened
elimination
half-life
of
ZEBETA
.
However
,
initial
dose
modification
is
generally
not
necessary
.
Pharmacokinetic
studies
document
no
clinically
relevant
interactions
with
other
agents
given
concomitantly
,
including
thiazide
,
,
and
.
There
was
no
effect
of
ZEBETA
on
prothrombin
time
in
patients
on
stable
doses
of
.
Risk
of
Anaphylactic
Reaction
:
While
taking
beta-blockers
,
patients
with
a
history
of
severe
anaphylactic
reaction
to
a
variety
of
allergens
may
be
more
reactive
to
repeated
challenge
,
either
accidental
,
diagnostic
,
or
therapeutic
.
Such
patients
may
be
unresponsive
to
the
usual
doses
of
used
to
treat
allergic
reactions
.
Metformin
:
In
healthy
subjects
given
single
500
mg
doses
of
cephalexin
and
,
plasma
mean
cmax
and
AUC
increased
by
an
average
of
34
%
and
24
%
,
respectively
,
and
mean
renal
clearance
decreased
by
14
%
.
No
information
is
available
about
the
interaction
of
cephalexin
and
following
multiple
doses
of
either
drug
.
Although
not
observed
in
this
study
,
adverse
effects
could
potentially
arise
from
co-administration
of
cephalexin
and
by
inhibition
of
tubular
secretion
via
organic
cationic
transporter
systems
.
Accordingly
,
careful
patient
monitoring
and
dose
adjustment
of
is
recommended
in
patients
concomitantly
taking
cephalexin
and
.
:
As
with
other
b-lactams
,
the
renal
excretion
of
cephalexin
is
inhibited
by
.
Drug
/
Laboratory
Test
Interactions
As
a
result
of
administration
of
Keflex
,
a
false-positive
reaction
for
in
the
urine
may
occur
.
This
has
been
observed
with
Benedict
s
and
Fehling
s
solutions
and
also
with
Clinitest
tablets
.
Potential
drug
interactions
for
doxylamine
include
,
increased
sedation
if
doxylamine
is
combined
with
other
CNS
depressant
.
may
partially
counteract
the
anticoagulation
effects
of
or
.
Doxylamine
may
enhance
the
effects
of
.
In
vitro
studies
have
shown
that
,
because
of
its
affinity
for
protein
,
6MNA
may
displace
other
protein-bound
from
their
binding
site
.
Caution
should
be
exercised
when
administering
nabumetone
with
since
interactions
have
been
seen
with
other
NSAIDs
.
Concomitant
administration
of
an
aluminum-containing
antacid
had
no
significant
effect
in
the
bioavailability
of
6MNA
.
When
administered
with
food
or
milk
,
there
is
more
rapid
absorption
;
however
,
the
total
amount
of
6MNA
in
the
plasma
is
unchanged
.
Potential
for
Interaction
with
Monoamine
Oxidase
Inhibitors
In
patients
receiving
another
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
drug
in
combination
with
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
(
MAOI
)
,
there
have
been
reports
of
serious
,
sometimes
fatal
,
reactions
including
hyperthermia
,
rigidity
,
myoclonus
,
autonomic
instability
with
possible
rapid
fluctuations
of
vital
signs
,
and
mental
status
changes
that
include
extreme
agitation
progressing
to
delirium
and
coma
.
These
reactions
have
also
been
reported
in
patients
who
have
discontinued
that
drug
and
have
been
started
on
a
MAOI
.
Some
cases
presented
with
features
resembling
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
.
Therefore
,
it
is
recommended
that
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
not
be
used
in
combination
with
MAOIs
,
or
within
14
days
of
discontinuing
treatment
with
a
MAOI
.
After
stopping
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
,
at
least
2
weeks
should
be
allowed
before
starting
a
MAOI
.
Potential
,
,
and
Interactions
,
and
are
all
metabolized
by
the
cytochrome
P450IIIA4
isozyme
,
and
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
IIIA4
,
blocks
the
metabolism
of
these
,
resulting
in
increased
plasma
concentrations
of
parent
drug
.
Increased
plasma
concentrations
of
,
,
and
cause
QT
prolongation
and
have
been
associated
with
torsades
de
pointes-type
ventricular
tachycardia
,
sometimes
fatal
.
As
noted
below
,
a
sub-
for
in
combination
with
,
a
drug
that
is
known
to
be
metabolized
by
the
IIIA4
isozyme
.
Although
it
has
not
been
definitively
demonstrated
that
is
a
potent
IIIA4
inhibitor
,
it
is
likely
to
be
,
given
the
substantial
interaction
of
with
.
Consequently
,
it
is
recommended
that
not
be
used
in
combination
with
either
terbinafine
,
,
or
.
Other
Potentially
Important
Drug
Interactions
:
Benzodiazepines
:
Benzodiazepines
metabolized
by
hepatic
oxidation
(
e.g.
,
,
,
elc
.
)
should
be
used
with
caution
because
the
clearance
of
these
is
likely
to
be
reduced
by
.
The
clearance
of
benzodiazepines
metabolized
by
glucuronidation
(
e.
g.
,
,
,
)
is
unlikely
to
be
affected
by
.
Alprazolam
:
When
maleate
(
100
mg
qd
)
and
(
1
mg
q.d
.
were
co-administered
to
steady
state
,
plasma
concentration
and
other
pharmacokinetics
parameters
(
AUC
,
Cmax
,
T1/2
,
)
of
were
approximately
twice
those
observed
when
was
administered
alone
;
oral
clearance
was
reduced
by
about
50
%
.
The
elevated
plasma
concentrations
resulted
in
decreased
psychomotor
performance
and
memory
.
This
interaction
,
which
has
not
been
investigated
using
higher
doses
of
,
may
be
more
pronounced
if
a
300
mg
daily
dose
is
co-administered
,
particularly
since
exhibits
non-linear
pharmacokinetics
over
the
dosage
range
100-300
mg
.
If
is
co-administered
with
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
,
the
initial
dosage
should
be
at
least
halved
and
titration
to
the
lowest
effective
dose
is
recommended
.
No
dosage
adjustment
is
required
for
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
.
:
The
co-administration
of
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
and
is
generally
not
advisable
.
Because
reduces
the
clearance
of
both
and
its
active
metabolite
,
N-desmethyldiazepam
,
there
is
a
strong
likelihood
of
substantial
accumulation
of
both
species
during
chronic
co-administration
.
Evidence
supporting
the
conclusion
that
it
is
inadvisable
to
co-administer
and
is
derived
from
a
study
in
which
healthy
volunteers
taking
150
mg/day
of
were
administered
a
single
oral
dose
of
10
mg
of
.
In
these
subjects
(
R=
B
)
,
the
clearance
of
was
reduced
by
65
%
and
that
of
N-desmethyldiazepam
to
a
level
that
was
too
low
to
measure
over
the
course
of
the
2
week
long
study
.
It
is
likely
that
experience
significantly
underestimates
the
degree
of
accumulation
that
might
occur
with
repealed
administration
.
Moreover
,
as
noted
with
,
the
effect
of
may
even
be
more
pronounced
when
it
is
administered
at
higher
doses
.
Accordingly
,
and
should
not
ordinarily
be
co-administered
.
:
The
effect
of
steady-state
l50
mg
bid
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
a
single
dose
of
(
375
mg
)
as
442
mg
was
evaluated
in
12
healthy
non-smoking
,
male
volunteers
.
The
clearance
of
was
decreased
approximately
3-fold
.
Therefore
,
if
is
co-administered
with
maleate
,
its
dose
should
be
reduced
to
one
third
of
the
usual
daily
maintenance
dose
and
plasma
concentrations
of
should
to
monitored
.
No
dosage
adjustment
is
required
for
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
.
:
When
maleate
(
50
mg
tid
)
was
administered
concomitantly
with
for
two
weeks
,
plasma
concentrations
increased
by
98
%
and
prothrombin
times
were
prolonged
.
Thus
patients
receiving
oral
anticoagulants
and
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
should
have
their
prothrombin
time
monitored
and
their
dose
adjusted
accordingly
.
No
dosage
adjustment
is
required
for
Fluvoxamine
Tablets
.
Systemic
antibiotic
agents
.
Understanding
the
breadth
of
systemic
antimicrobial
agents
available
for
use
by
the
dermatologist
and
their
associated
side-effect
profiles
and
drug
interactions
allows
the
clinician
to
offer
patients
optimal
care
in
the
management
of
cutaneous
infectious
disease
.
Ergot-containing
have
been
reported
to
cause
prolonged
vasospastic
reactions
.
Because
there
is
a
theoretical
basis
that
these
effects
may
be
additive
,
use
of
ergotamine-containing
or
ergot-type
medications
(
like
or
methysergide
)
and
sumatriptan
within
24
hours
of
each
other
should
be
avoided
.
MAO-A
inhibitors
reduce
sumatriptan
clearance
,
significantly
increasing
systemic
exposure
.
Therefore
,
the
use
of
sumatriptan
succinate
tablets
in
patients
receiving
MAO-A
inhibitors
is
contraindicated
.
Selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
(
e.g.
,
,
,
,
)
have
been
reported
,
rarely
,
to
cause
weakness
,
hyperreflexia
,
and
incoordination
when
coadministered
with
sumatriptan
.
If
concomitant
treatment
with
sumatriptan
and
an
SSRI
is
clinically
warranted
,
appropriate
observation
of
the
patient
is
advised
.
Studies
in
vitro
show
that
caspofungin
acetate
is
not
an
inhibitor
of
any
enzyme
in
the
cytochrome
P450
(
CYP
)
system
.
In
clinical
studies
,
caspofungin
did
not
induce
the
metabolism
of
other
.
Caspofungin
is
not
a
substrate
for
P-glycoprotein
and
is
a
poor
substrate
for
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
.
Clinical
studies
in
healthy
volunteers
show
that
the
pharmacokinetics
of
CANCIDAS
are
not
altered
by

B
,
mycophenolate

or
.
CANCIDAS
has
no
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
,
B
,
or
the
active
metabolite
of
mycophenolate
.
CANCIDAS
reduced
the
blood
AUC0-12
of

approximately
20
%
,
peak
blood
concentration
(
Cmax
)
by
16

26
%
in
healthy
subjects
when
(
2

of
CANCIDAS
70
mg
daily
,
as
compared
to
results
from
a

in
which
was
administered
alone
.
For
patients
receiving
both
therapies
,
standard
monitoring
of
blood
concentrations
and
appropriate
dosage
adjustments
are
recommended
.
In
two
clinical
studies
,
(
one
4
mg/kg
dose
or
two
3
mg/kg
doses
)
increased
the
AUC
of
caspofungin
by
approximately
35
%

CANCIDAS
did
not
increase
the
plasma

There
were
transient
increases
in
liver
ALT
and
AST
when
CANCIDAS
and
were
co-administered

A
drug-drug
interaction
study
with
in
healthy
volunteers
has
shown
a
30
%
decrease
in
caspofungin
trough
concentrations
.
Patients
on
should
receive
70
mg
of
CANCIDAS
daily
.
In
addition
,
results
from
regression
analyses
of
patient
pharmacokinetic
data
suggest
that
co-administration
of
other
inducers
of
drug
clearance
(
,
,
,
,

with
CANCIDAS
may
result
in
clinically
meaningful
reductions
in
caspofungin
concentrations

It
is
not
known
which
drug
clearance
mechanism
involved
in
caspofungin

,
such
as

use
of
a

Rhabdomyolysis
secondary
to
a
drug
interaction
between
and
.
OBJECTIVE
:
To
report
a
case
of
rhabdomyolysis
resulting
from
concomitant
use
of
and
.
CASE
SUMMARY
:
A
64-year-old
African-American
man
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
worsening
renal
failure
,
elevated
creatine
phosphokinase
,
diffuse
muscle
pain
,
and
severe
muscle
weakness
.
About
three
weeks
prior
to
admission
,
the
patient
was
started
on
for
sinusitis
.
The
patient
had
been
receiving
for
approximately
six
months
.
He
was
treated
aggressively
with
intravenous
hydration
,
sodium
bicarbonate
,
and
hemodialysis
.
A
muscle
biopsy
revealed
necrotizing
myopathy
secondary
to
a
.
The
patient
continued
to
receive
intermittent
hemodialysis
until
his
death
from
infectious
complications
that
occurred
three
months
after
admission
.
There
were
several
factors
that
could
have
increased
his
risk
for
developing
rhabdomyolysis
,
including
chronic
renal
failure
.
DISCUSSION
:
is
a
potent
inhibitor
of
,
the
major
enzyme
responsible
for
metabolism
.
The
concomitant
administration
of
macrolide
antibiotics
and
other
hydroxymethylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
(
HMG-CoA
)
reductase
inhibitors
have
resulted
in
previous
reports
of
rhabdomyolysis
.
Other
factors
may
increase
the
risk
of
this
drug
interaction
,
including
the
administration
of
other
medications
that
are
associated
with
myopathy
,
underlying
renal
insufficiency
,
and
administration
of
high
doses
of
HMG-CoA
reductase
inhibitors
.
CONCLUSIONS
:
Macrolide
antibiotics
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
HMG-CoA
reductase
inhibitors
that
are
metabolized
by
(
i.e.
,
,
,
,
)
.
This
interaction
may
result
in
myopathy
and
rhabdomyolysis
,
particularly
in
patients
with
renal
insufficiency
or
those
who
are
concurrently
taking
medications
associated
with
myopathy
.
If
ProSom
is
given
concomitantly
with
other
acting
on
the
central
nervous
system
,
careful
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
pharmacology
of
all
agents
.
The
action
of
the
benzodiazepines
may
be
potentiated
by
anticonvulsants
,
,
,
barbiturates
,
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
,
narcotics
,

Smokers
have
an
increased
clearance
of
benzodiazepines
as
compared
to
nonsmokers
;
this
was
seen
in
studies
with
estazolam
.
While
no
in
vivo
drug-drug
interaction
studies
were
conducted
between
estazolam

,
compounds
that
are
potent

Estazolam
:
Interaction
with
Drugs
that
Inhibit
Metabolism
via
Cytochrome
P450
3A
(
CYP3A
)
:
The
metabolism
of
estazolam
to
the
major
circulating
metabolite
4-hydroxy-estazolam
and
the
metabolism
of
other
triazolobenzodiazepines
is
catalyzed
by
CYP3A
.
Consequently
,
estazolam
should
be
avoided
in
patients
receiving
and
,
which
are
very
potent
inhibitors
of
CYP3A
.
With
inhibiting
CYP3A
to
a
lesser
,
but
still
significant
degree
,
estazolam
should
be
used
only
with
caution
and
consideration
of
appropriate
dosage
reduction
.
The
following
are
examples
of
known
to
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
other
related
benzodiazepines
,
presumably
through
inhibition
of
CYP3A
:
,
,
,
,
isoniazide
,
and
some
macrolide
antibiotics

Drug
Interaction
with

assess
the
effect
of
20
mg
BID
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
estazolam
2
mg
QHS
after
seven
days
.
The
pharmacokinetics
of
estazolam
(
Cmax
and
AUC
)
were
not
affected
during
multiple-dose
,
suggesting
no
clinically
significant
pharmacokinetic
interaction

Estazolam
:
Interaction
with
Other
Drugs
that
are
Metabolized
by
Cytochrome
P450
(
CYP
)
:
At
clinically
relevant
concentrations
,
in
vitro
studies
indicate
that
estazolam
(
0.6
M
)
was
not
inhibitory
towards
the
major
cytochrome
P450
isoforms
,
CYP2A6
,
,
CYP2C19
,
,
CYP2E1
,
and
CYP3A
.
Therefore
,
based
on
these
in
vitro
data
,
estazolam
is
very
unlikely
to
inhibit
the
biotransformation
of
other
metabolized
by
these
CYP
isoforms
.

dose-dependently
increased
the

At

the
diarrhea-inducing
effects
of
dmPGE2
were
more
pronounced
in
cecectomized
than
in
control
rats
.
When
given
i.p.
,
dmPGE2
(
0.3
mg/kg

induced
a
watery
stool
in
cecectomized

the
basal
and
dmPGE2-induced
jejunal
net

On
the
other
hand
,
the
enhanced
secretion
of
colonic
fluid
by
dmPGE2
,
given
intraluminally

was
only
half
of

N-methyllevallorphan
(
5
mg/kg

completely
antagonized
the
inhibitory
effect
of
loperamide
and
partly
antagonized
the

These
results
suggest
that
oral
administration
of
dmPGE2
induces
a
more
pronounced
secretory
diarrhea
in
cecectomized

in
control
rats
,
probably
due
to
the
lack
of
the
reservoir
function
of

Multiple

Conversely
,
at
exposure
levels
close
to
the

sometimes
been
observed
and
the
behaviour
of
the
biological
indicators
differs
from
what
would
be
expected
.
Toxicodynamic
interference
between
solvents
can
give
rise
to
additive

However

In

The
mechanism
of
resveratrol-induced
vasorelaxation
differs
in
the
mesenteric
resistance
arteries
of
lean
and
obese
rats
.
Resveratrol
has
been
shown
to
induce
vasorelaxation
.
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
mechanism
(
s
)
of
resveratrol-induced
vasorelaxation
in
resistance
mesenteric
arteries
from
male
lean
and
dietary-induced
obese
rats
.
Compared
with
lean
rats
,
arteries
from
dietary-obese
rats
showed
significant
(
P
<
0.001
)
endothelial
dysfunction
,
as
indicated
by
a
decrease
(
>
20
%
)
in
maximal
acetylcholine-induced
vasorelaxation
.
Resveratrol
(
5-35
micromol/l
)
induced
concentration-dependent
relaxation
of
mesenteric
arteries
preconstricted
with
(
8
micromol/l
)
or
KCl
(
125
mmol/l
)
from
both
lean
and
dietary-obese
rats
.
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
two
groups
,
achieving
a
maximum
relaxation
of
>
95
%
at
a
concentration
of
35
micromol/l
.
However
,
L-NAME
(
100
and
300
micromol/l
)

not
alter
the
effects
of
reseveratrol
on
arteries
from
dietary-obese
rats

concentration-responses
curves
.
was
also
ineffective
in
altering
resveratrol
activity
in
arteries
from
both
lean
and
dietary-obese
rats
.
In
noradrenaline-precontracted
arteries
from
dietary-obese
rats
,
responses
to
resveratrol
were
not
attenuated
by
endothelial
denudation
,
indicating
an
action
independent
of
the
endothelium
.
This
study
indicates
that
:
(
a
)
the
maximal
effects
of
resveratrol
on
resistance
arteries
from
lean
and
dietary-obese
rats
are
not
effected
by
endothelial
dysfunction
,
and
(
b
)
the
effects
of
resveratrol
in
lean
animals
(
where
endothelial
function
is
not
impaired
)
,
but
not
in
dietary-obese
rats
,

ELLENCE
when
used
in
combination
with
other
cytotoxic
may
show
on-treatment
additive
toxicity
,
especially
hematologic
and
gastrointestinal
effects
.
Concomitant
use
of
ELLENCE
with
other
cardioactive
compounds
that
could
cause
heart
failure
(
e.g.
,
channel
blockers
)
,
requires
close
monitoring
of
cardiac
function
throughout
treatment
.
There
are
few
data
regarding
the
coadministration
of
radiation
therapy
and
epirubicin
.
In
adjuvant
trials
of
epirubicin-containing
CEF-120
or
FEC-100
chemotherapies
,
breast
irradiation
was
delayed
until
after
chemotherapy
was
completed
.
This
practice
resulted
in
no
apparent
increase
in
local
breast
cancer
recurrence
relative
to
published
accounts
in
the
literature
.
A
small
number
of
patients
received
epirubicin-based
chemotherapy
concomitantly
with
radiation
therapy
but
had
chemotherapy
interrupted
in
order
to
avoid
potential
overlapping
toxicities
.
It
is
likely
that
use
of
epirubicin
with
radiotherapy
may
sensitize
tissues
to
the
cytotoxic
actions
of
irradiation
.
Administration
of
ELLENCE
after
previous
radiation
therapy
may
induce
an
inflammatory
recall
reaction
at
the
site
of
the
irradiation
.
Epirubicin
is
extensively
metabolized
by
the
liver
.
Changes
in

Clinically
meaningful

have
occurred
with

but
are
not
limited
to
the
following
:
Agents
Highly
Bound
to
Plasma
Protein
is
not
highly

to
plasma
proteins
;
therefore
,
administration
of
EQUETROTM
to
a
patient
taking
another
drug
that
is
highly
protein
bound
should
not
cause
increased
free

Agents
that
Inhibit
Cytochrome

Isoenzymes
and/or
Epoxide
Hydrolase
is
metabolized
mainly
by
cytochrome

(
CYP

3A4
to
the
active
10,11-epoxide
,
which
is
further
metabolized
to
the
trans-diol
by
epoxide
hydrolase
.
Therefore
,
the
potential
exists
for
interaction
between
and
any
agent
that
inhibits
and/or
epoxide
hydrolase
.
Agents
that
are
inhibitors
that
have
been
found
,
or
are
expected
,
to
increase
plasma
levels
of
EQUETROTM
are
the
following
:
Acetazolamide

,
protease

Thus
,
if
a
patient
has
been
titrated
to
a
stable
dosage
of
EQUETROTM
,
and
then
begins
a
course
of
treatment
with
one
of
these
or
epoxide
hydrolase
inhibitors
,
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a
dose
reduction
for
EQUETROTM
may
be
necessary
.
Agents
that
Induce

Therefore
,
the
potential

Agents
that
are
CYP
inducers
that
have
been

are
the
following
:
Cisplatin
,
HCL
,
,
,
,
(

)
,
primidone
,
methsuximide
,
and
Thus
,
if
a
patient
has
been
titrated
to
a
stable
dosage
on
EQUETROTM
,
and
then
begins
a
course
of
treatment
with
one
of
these
inducers
,
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a

Therefore
,
the
potential
exists
for
interaction
between
and
any
agent
metabolized
by
one
(
or
more
)
of
these
enzymes

Agents
that
have

are
expected
to
have
decreased
plasma

in
the

Thus
,
if
a

on
one
of
the
agents
in
this
category

it
is
reasonable
to

Agents
with
Increased

EQUETROTM
increases
the
plasma
levels
of
the
following
agents
:
Clomipramine

and
primidone
Thus
,
if
a

has
been
titrated
to
a
stable
dosage
on
one
of
the
agents
in
this
category
,
and
then

EQUETROTM
,
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a

may
be
necessary
.
Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic
Interactions
with
Concomitant
administration
of
and
may
increase
the
risk
of
neurotoxic
side
effects
.
Given
the
anticonvulsant
properties
of
,
EQUETROTM
may
reduce
the
thyroid
function
as
has
been
reported
with
other
anticonvulsants
.
Additionally
,
anti-malarial
,
such
as
and
mefloquine
,
may
antagonize
the
activity
of
.
Thus
if
a
patient
has
been
titrated
to
a
stable
dosage
on
one
of
the
agents
in
this
category
,
and
then
begins
a
course
of
treatment
with
EQUETROTM
,
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a
dose
adjustment
may
be
necessary
.
Because
of
its
primary
CNS
effect
,
caution
should
be
used
when
EQUETROTM
is
taken
with
other

Lack
of
interaction
between
levofloxacin
and
oxycodone
:
pharmacokinetics
and
drug
disposition
.
Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
a
significant
reduction
in
the
oral
bioavailability
of
trovafloxacin
and
when
administered
concomitantly
with
an
intravenous
opiate
such
as
.
This
decrease
in
absorption
results
in
a
36
%
and
50
%
lower
AUC
for
trovafloxacin
and
,
respectively
,
which
could
cause
clinical
failures
.
The
authors
investigated
the
possibility
of
a
similar
interaction
between
oxycodone
and
levofloxacin
.
Eight
healthy
volunteers
were
randomized
in
an
open-label

two-way
crossover
study
to
receive
oxycodone

There
was
not
a
significant
difference
(
p

)
in
AUC
(
48.59
+/-
8.52
vs.

,
Cmax
(

1.1
+/-
0.6
vs.
1.6
+/-
1.1
)
for
levofloxacin
versus

regimens
.
It
was
concluded
that
oral
oxycodone

can
be
administered
concomitantly
without
a
significant

Potential
for
Other
Drugs
to
Affect
Duloxetine
:
Both
and
are
responsible
for
duloxetine
metabolism
.
Inhibitors
of
:
Concomitant
use
of
duloxetine
with
,
an
inhibitor
of

results
in
approximately
a
6-fold
increase
in
AUC
and
about
a
2.5-fold
increase
in
Cmax
of
duloxetine
.
Some
quinolone
antibiotics
would
be
expected
to
have
similar
effects
and
these
combinations
should
be
avoided
.
Inhibitors
of
:
Because
is
involved
in
duloxetine
metabolism
,
concomitant
use
of
duloxetine
with
potent
inhibitors
of
may
result
in
higher
concentrations
of
duloxetine
.
(
20
mg
QD
)
increased
the
concentration
of
duloxetine
(
40
mg
QD
)
by
about
60
%
,
and
greater
degrees
of
inhibition
are
expected
with
higher
doses
of

Similar
effects
would
be
expected
with
other
potent
inhibitors
(
e.g.
,
,
)
.
Potential
for
Duloxetine
to
Affect
Other
Drugs
:
Drugs
Metabolized
by
:
In
vitro
drug
interaction
studies
demonstrate
that
duloxetine
does
not
induce
activity
,
and
it
is
unlikely
to
have
a
clinically
significant
effect
on
the
metabolism
of
substrates
.
Drugs
Metabolized
by
:
Duloxetine
is
a
moderate
inhibitor
of

When
duloxetine
was
administered
(
at
a
dose
of
60
mg
BID
)
in
conjunction
with
a
single
50-mg
dose
of
,
a
substrate
,
the
AUC
of
increased
3-fold
.
Therefore
,
co-administration
of
Duloxetine
with
other
that
are
extensively
metabolized
by
this
isozyme
and
which
have
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
,
including
certain
antidepressants
(
tricyclic
antidepressants
[
TCAs
]
,
such
as
,
,
and
)
,
phenothiazines
and
Type
1C
antiarrhythmics
(
e.g.
,
,
)
,
should
be
approached
with
caution
.
Plasma
TCA
concentrations
may
need
to
be
monitored
and
the
dose
of
the
TCA
may
need
to
be
reduced
if
a
TCA
is
co-administered
with
Duloxetine
.
Because
of
the
risk
of
serious
ventricular
arrhythmias
and
sudden
death
potentially
associated
with
elevated
plasma
levels
of
,
Duloxetine
and
should
not
be
co-administered
.
Drugs
Metabolized
by
CYP3A
:
Results
of
in

studies
demonstrate
that
duloxetine
does
not
inhibit
or
induce
CYP3A

Duloxetine
May
Have
a
Clinically
Important
Interaction
with
the
Following
Other
Drugs
:
:
When
Duloxetine
and
were
administered
several
hours
apart
so
that
peak
concentrations
of
each
would
coincide
,
Duloxetine
did
not
increase
the
impairment
of
mental
and
motor
skills
caused
by
.
In
the
Duloxetine
clinical
trials
database
,
three
Duloxetine-treated
patients
had
liver
injury
as
manifested
by
ALT
and
total
bilirubin
elevations
,
with
evidence
of
obstruction
.
Substantial
intercurrent
use
was
present
in
each
of
these
cases
,
and
this
may
have
contributed
to
the
abnormalities
seen
.
CNS
Acting
Drugs
:
Given
the
primary
CNS
effects
of
Duloxetine
,
it
should
be
used
with
caution
when
it
is
taken
in
combination
with
or
substituted
for
other
centrally
acting
,
including
those
with
a
similar
mechanism
of
action
.
Potential
for
Interaction
with
Drugs
that
Affect
Gastric
Acidity
:
Duloxetine
has
an
enteric
coating
that
resists
dissolution
until
reaching
a
segment
of
the
gastrointestinal
tract
where
the
pH
exceeds
5.5
.
In
extremely
acidic
conditions
,
Duloxetine
,
unprotected
by
the
enteric
coating
,
may
undergo
hydrolysis
to
form
naphthol
.
Caution
is
advised
in
using
Duloxetine
in
patients
with
conditions
that
may
slow
gastric
emptying
(
e.g.
,
some
diabetics
)
.
Drugs
that
raise
the
gastrointestinal
pH
may
lead
to
an
earlier
release
of
duloxetine
.
However
,
co-administration
of
Duloxetine
with
aluminum-
and
magnesium-containing
(
51
mEq
)
or
Duloxetine
with
,
had
no
significant
effect
on
the
rate
or
extent
of
duloxetine
absorption
after
administration
of
a
40-mg
oral
dose
.
It
is
unknown
whether
the
concomitant
administration
of
proton
pump
inhibitors
affects
duloxetine
absorption
.
ACE
inhibitors
:
Reports
suggest
that
NSAIDs
may
diminish
the
antihypertensive
effect
of
Angiotensin
Converting
Enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
.
In
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
,
administration
of
25
mg
daily
of
VIOXX
with
the
ACE
inhibitor
benazepril
,
10
to
40
mg
for
4
weeks
,
was
associated
with
an
average
increase
in
mean
arterial
pressure
of
about
3
mm
Hg
compared
to
ACE
inhibitor
alone
.
This
interaction
should
be
given
consideration
in
patients
taking
VIOXX
concomitantly
with
ACE
inhibitors
.
:
Concomitant
administration
of
low-dose
with
VIOXX
may
result
in
an
increased
rate
of
GI
ulceration
or
other
complications
,
compared
to
use
of
VIOXX
alone
.
In
a
12-week
endoscopy
study
conducted
in
OA
patients
there
was
no
difference
in
the
cumulative
incidence
of
endoscopic
gastroduodenal
ulcers
in
patients
taking
low-dose
(
81
mg
)
enteric
coated
plus
VIOXX
25
mg
daily
,
as
compared
to
those
taking
2400
mg
daily
alone
.
Patients
taking
low-dose
plus
were
not
studied
.
At
steady
state
,
VIOXX
50
mg
once
daily
had
no
effect
on
the
anti-platelet
activity
of
low-dose
(
81
mg
once
daily
)
,
as
assessed
by
ex
vivo
platelet
aggregation
and
serum
TXB2
generation
in
clotting
blood
.
Because
of
its
lack
of
platelet
effects
,
VIOXX
is
not
a
substitute
for
for
cardiovascular
prophylaxis
.
Therefore
,
in
patients
taking
VIOXX
,
antiplatelet
therapies
should
not
be
discontinued
and
should
be
considered
in
patients
with
an
indication
for
cardiovascular
prophylaxis
.
Prospective

long-term
studies
on
concomitant
administration
of
VIOXX

have
shown
that
NSAIDs
can
reduce
the
natriuretic

This

there
have
been
reports
of
increases

Thus
,
when

be
observed
carefully
for
signs

Co-administration
of
VIOXX
with

,
a
potent
inducer
of
hepatic
metabolism
,
produced
an
approximate
50
%
decrease
in

plasma
concentrations
.
Therefore
,
a
starting
daily
dose
of
25
mg
of
VIOXX
should
be
considered
for
the
treatment
of
osteoarthritis
when
VIOXX

of
hepatic
metabolism
.
VIOXX
12.5

These
data
suggest
that
rofecoxib
may
produce
a
modest
inhibition
of

.
Therefore
,
there
is
a
potential
for
an
interaction
with
other

are
metabolized
by
CYP
1A2
(
e.g.
,
,
tacrine

:
Anticoagulant

should
be
monitored
,
particularly
in
the
first
few
days
after
initiating
or
changing
VIOXX
therapy
in
patients
receiving
or
similar
agents
,
since
these
patients
are
at
an
increased
risk
of
bleeding
complications
.
In

studies
in
healthy
subjects
receiving
both

rofecoxib
,
prothrombin
time
(
measured
as
INR
)
was
increased
by
approximately
8
%
to
11

In
post-marketing
experience
,
bleeding

,
preliminary
whole-cell
,
tight
seal
recordings
of
rat
spinal
substantia
gelatinosa
neurons
including
biocytin
in
the
patch
pipette
yielded
a
significantly
smaller
proportion
of
neurons
hyperpolarized
by
selective
opioid
agonists
compared
with
recordings
without
biocytin
.
Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
biocytin
inclusion
on
opioid
responses
and
other
membrane
properties
during
whole-cell
,
tight
seal
recordings
of
these
neurons
.
The
percentage
of
neurons
hyperpolarized
by
mu-
,
delta
(
1
)
-
,
and
kappa-selective
opioids
was
significantly
reduced
when
1
%

not
<
or
=0.2
%
biocytin
was
included
in
the
recording
pipette
,
compared
with
neurons
recorded
without
biocytin
.
However
,
a
significantly
higher
proportion
of
neurons
fired
spontaneous
action
potentials
with
either
0.05-0.2
or
1
%
biocytin
compared
to
no
biocytin
.
Resting
membrane
potential
,
input
impedance
and
the
proportion
of
neurons
displaying
transient
outward
rectification
were
each
significantly
altered
for
neurons
recorded
with
1
%
but
not
0.05-0.2
%
biocytin
.
These
effects
may
be
due
to
a
relatively
specific
blockade
of
diverse
channel
types
.
Because
efficient
labeling
can
be
achieved
with
0.1

biocytin
with
whole-cell

,
higher
concentrations
are
contraindicated
.
Modification
of
surface
histidine
residues
abolishes
the
cytotoxic
activity
of
Clostridium
difficile
A
.
Clostridium
difficile
A
displays
both
cytotoxic
and
enterotoxic
activities
.
It
has
recently
been
demonstrated
that
A
exerts
its
cytotoxic
effect
by
the
glucosylation
of
the
small
GTP-binding
proteins
of
the
Rho
family
.
Diethyl
pyrocarbonate
,
at
pH
7.0
,
was
used
to
chemically
modify
exposed
histidine
residues
on
A
.
Modification
of
A
with
diethyl
pyrocarbonate
abolished
both
its
cytotoxic
activity
and
the
ability
of
the
to
bind
Zn-Sepharose
gel
.
Treatment
of
A
with
[
(
14
)
C
]
-diethyl
pyrocarbonate
revealed
concentration
dependent
labelling
of
histidine
residues
on
the
molecules
.
The
effects
of
diethyl
pyrocarbonate
could
be
reversed
by
hydroxylamine
treatment
.
These
data
suggest
the
modified
histidine
residues
on
A
are
critical
to
its
cytotoxic
activity
.
Histidine
modification
had
no
effect
on
the
glucosyl
transferase
enzyme
activity
of
A
.
However
,
modification
abolished
the
'cold
'
binding
of
to
bovine
thyroglobulin
in
an
ELISA
and
reduced
ligand
binding
activity
in
a
rabbit
erythrocyte
haemagglutination
assay
.
The
data
suggest
that
the
histidine
residues
may
be
crucial
to
the
receptor-binding
activity
of
A
.
Exposed
histidines
on
A
are
available
for
chelation
,
and
these
have
been
exploited
in
the
development
of
a
novel
purification
protocol
for

we
examined
the
interactions
between
1,25

2D3
and
the
antiestrogen
4-hydroxytamoxifen
(
TAM

,
which
also
induces

suggest
that
TAM
significantly
potentiates
the
reduction
in

Combined

Treatment
of

These

emphasize
that

:
The
glitazones
or
sensitizers
.
Type
2
diabetes
mellitus
is
a
growing
problem
not
only
in
the
United
States
but
also
across
the
world
.
There
is
now
strong
evidence
that
intensive
control
of
blood
can
significantly
reduce
and
retard
the
microvascular
complications
of
retinopathy
,
nephropathy
,
and
neuropathy
.
Ultimately
however
,
up
to
80
%
of
type
2
diabetics
die
from
macrovascular
cardiovascular
disease
.
This
increased
incidence
of
atherosclerotic
disease
is
intricately
associated
with
resistance
,
which
is
a
major
pathophysiologic
abnormality
in
type
2
diabetes
.
There
is
strong
evidence
that
resistance
is
involved
in
the
development
of
not
only
hyperglycemia
,
but
also
dyslipidemia
,
hypertension
,
hypercoagulation
,
vasculopathy
,
and
ultimately
atherosclerotic
cardiovascular
disease
.
This
cluster
of
metabolic
abnormalities
has
been
termed
the
resistance
or
cardiovascular
dysmetabolic
syndrome
.
The
thiazolidinediones
(
rosiglitazone
and
pioglitazone
)
,
a
new
class
of
oral
antidiabetic
agents
,
are
``
sensitizers
''
and
exert
direct
effects
on
the
mechanisms
of
resistance
.
These
effects
not
only
improve
sensitivity
and
glycemic
control
with
reduced
requirements
,
but
also
have
potentially
favorable
effects
on
other
components
of
the
cardiovascular
dysmetabolic
syndrome
.
Long-term
studies
are
needed
to
determine
whether
the
insulin-sensitizing
effects
of
the
glitazones
can
prevent
or
delay
premature
atherosclerotic
cardiovascular
disease
,
morbidity
,
and
death

citrate
:
a
therapeutic
update
.
BACKGROUND
:
Since
its
approval
by
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
in
March
1998
,
citrate
has
been
used
by
millions
of
men
for
the
treatment
of
erectile
dysfunction
.
Recent
studies
and
consensus
reports
have
expanded
our
understanding
of
its
efficacy
,
safety
,
contraindications
,
and
drug
interactions
.
OBJECTIVE
:
This
paper
reviews
recent
studies
of
the
efficacy
of
,
its
adverse
effects
and
drug
interactions
,
and
socioeconomic
factors
involved
in
its
use
,
with
a
focus
on
specific
patient
populations
(
prostate
cancer
,
diabetes

,
ischemic
heart
disease
,
spinal

injuries
,
neurologic
disorders
)
.
METHODS
:
Clinical

an
effective
first-line
therapy
for
erectile

:
:
has
been
reported
to
reduce
intestinal
absorption
of
fat
soluble
vitamins
;
as
such
it
may
impair
intestinal
absorption
of
any
of
vitamin
D
.
Phenytoin/Phenobarbital
:
The
coadministration
of
or
will
not
affect
plasma
concentrations
of
vitamin
D
,
but
may
reduce
endogenous
plasma
levels
of
calcitriol/ergocalcitriol
by
accelerating
metabolism
.
Since

level
of
calcitriol/ergocalcitriol
will
be
reduced
,
higher
doses
of
Rocaltrol
may
be
necessary
if
these
are
administered
simultaneously
.
Thiazides
:
Thiazides
are
known
to
induce
hypercalcemia
by
the
reduction
of
excretion
in
urine
.
Some
reports
have
shown
that
the
concomitant
administration
of
thiazides
with
vitamin
D
causes
hypercalcemia
.
Therefore
,
precaution
should
be
taken
when

analogues
,
which
promote

.
Vitamin
D
:
The
coadministration
of
any
of
the

be
avoided
as
this
could
create
possible
additive
effects
and
hypercalcemia

arsenical
encephalopathy
in

Uganda
,
1992-1993
]
Since
1988
,
the
french
non-governmental
organisation
M
decins
Sans
Fronti
res
is
running
a
control
program
of
human
african
trypanosomiasis
in
the
district
of
Moyo
,
North-Uganda
.
Between
1988
and
1993
,
more
than
7,000
patients
were
diagnosed
and
treated
.
Since
1988
,
it
has
been
noted
that
incidence
of
melarsoprol
reaction
had
increased
systematically
between
June
and
October
of
each
year
,
indicating
strong
seasonal
variation
.
In
1992
and
1993
,
two
outbreaks
of
arsenical
reactive
encephalopathy
(
ARE
)
occurred
in
the
sleeping
sickness
center
of
Adjumani
.
The
incidence
of
ARE
suddenly
exceeded
10
%
of
the
patients
treated
by
melarsoprol
during
August
1992
and
September
1993
.
The
onset
of
80
%
of
those
``
epidemic
''
cases
,
occurred
between
the
5th
and
the
11th
day
of
treatment
.
Two
retrospective
studies
were
conducted
in
1992
(
75
cases
)
and
in
1993
(
51
cases
)
.
Among
the
risk
factors
studied
,
two
appear
to
increase
the
risk
of
ARE
:
the
prescription
of
thiabendazole
to
treat
strongyloidiasis
during
the
melarsoprol
cure
and
the
bad
general
clinical
conditions
of
patients
.
These
observations
suggest
that
exogenous
co-factors
could
be
involved
in
the
occurrence
of
ARE
.
Recommendations
were
to
avoid
administration
of
diffusible
anti-helminthic
treatment
during
the
cure
,
and
to
improve
the
general
conditions
of
patients
before
the
cure
of
melarsoprol

Molecular
basis
for
the
selective
toxicity
of
B
for
yeast
and
filipin
for
animal
cells
.
Among
the
polyene
antibiotics
,
many
,
like
filipin
,
can
not
be
used
clinically
because
they
are
toxic
;
B
,
however
,
is
useful
in
therapy
of
human
fungal
infections
because
it
is
less
toxic
.
Both
the
toxicity
of
filipin
and
the
therapeutic
value
of
B
can
be
rationalized
at
the
cellular
and
molecular
level
by
the
following
observations
:
(
i
)
these
polyene
antibiotics
showed
differential
effects
on
cells
;
filipin
was
more
potent
in
lysing
human
red
blood
cells
,
whereas
B
was
more
potent
in
inhibiting
yeast
cell
growth
;
and
(
ii
)
the
effects
of
filipin
were
more
efficiently
inhibited
by
added
cholesterol
,
the
major
membrane
sterol
in
human
cells
,
whereas
the
effects
of
B
were
more
efficiently
inhibited
by
ergosterol
,
the
major
membrane
sterol
in
yeast
.
The
simplest
inference
is
that
the
toxicity
and
effectiveness
of
polyenes
are
determined
by
their
relative
avidities
for
the
predominant
sterol
in
cell
membranes
.
No
formal
interaction
studies
have
been
performed
.
The
duration

Carcinogenesis
,
Mutagenesis
,
and
Fertility
In
a
chronic
toxicity
study
,
cynomolgus
monkeys
were
dosed
weekly
for
52
weeks
with
intravenous
alefacept
at
1
mg/kg/dose
or
20
mg/kg/dose
.
One
animal
in
the
high
dose
group
developed
a
B-cell
lymphoma
that
was
detected
after
28
weeks
of
dosing
.
Additional
animals
in
both
dose
groups
developed
B-cell
hyperplasia
of
the
spleen
and
lymph
nodes
.
All
animals
in
the
study
were
positive
for
an
endemic
primate
gammaherpes
virus
also
known
as
lymphocryptovirus
(
LCV
)
.
Latent
LCV
infection
is
generally
asymptomatic
,
but
can
lead
to
B-cell
lymphomas
when
animals
are
immune
suppressed
.
In
a
separate
study
,
baboons
given
3
doses
of
alefacept
at
1
mg/kg
every
8
weeks
were
found
to
have
centroblast
proliferation
in
B-cell
dependent
areas
in
the
germinal
centers
of
the
spleen
following
a
116-day
washout
period
.
The
role
of
AMEVIVE
in
the
development
of
the
lymphoid
malignancy
and
the
hyperplasia
observed
in
non-human
primates
and
the
relevance
to
humans
is
unknown
.
Immunodeficiency-associated
lymphocyte
disorders
(
plasmacytic
hyperplasia
,
polymorphic
proliferation
,
and
B-cell
lymphomas
)
occur
in
patients
who
have
congenital
or
acquired
immunodeficiencies
including
those
resulting
from
immunosuppressive
therapy
.
No
carcinogenicity
or
fertility
studies
were
conducted
.
Mutagenicity
studies
were
conducted
in

;
no
evidence
of

Pregnancy
(
Category
B
)
Women
of
childbearing
potential
make
up
a
considerable
segment
of
the
patient
population
affected
by
psoriasis
.
Since
the
effect
of
AMEVIVE
on
pregnancy
and
fetal
development
,
including
immune
system
development
,
is
not
known
,
health
care
providers
are
encouraged
to
enroll
patients
currently
taking
AMEVIVE
who
become
pregnant
into
the
Biogen
Pregnancy
Registry
by
calling
1-866-AMEVIVE
(
1-866-263-8483
)
.
Reproductive
toxicology
studies
have
been
performed
in
cynomolgus
monkeys
at
doses
up
to
5
mg/kg/week
(
about
62
times
the
human
dose
based
on
body
weight
)
and
have
revealed
no
evidence
of
impaired
fertility
or
harm
to
the
fetus
due
to
AMEVIVE
.
No
abortifacient
or
teratogenic
effects
were
observed
in
cynomolgus
monkeys
following
intravenous
bolus
injections
of
AMEVIVE
administered
weekly
during
the
period
of
organogenesis
to
gestation
.
AMEVIVE
underwent
trans-placental
passage
and
produced
in
utero
exposure
in
the
developing
monkeys
.
In
utero
,
serum
levels
of
exposure
in
these
monkeys
were
23
%
of
maternal
serum
levels
.
No
evidence
of
fetal
toxicity
including
adverse
effects
on
immune
system
development
was
observed
in
any
of
these
animals
.
Animal
reproduction
studies
,
however
,
are
not
always
predictive
of
human
response
and
there
are
no
adequate
and
well-controlled
studies
in
pregnant
women
.
Because
the
risk
to
the
development
of
the
fetal
immune
system
and
postnatal
immune
function
in
humans
is
unknown
,
AMEVIVE
should
be
used
during
pregnancy
only
if
clearly
needed
.
If
pregnancy
occurs
while
taking
AMEVIVE
,
continued
use
of
the
drug
should
be
assessed
.
Nursing
Mothers
It
is
not
known
whether
AMEVIVE
is
excreted
in
human
milk
.
Because
many
are
excreted
in
human
milk
,
and
because
there
exists
the
potential
for
serious
adverse
reactions
in
nursing
infants
from
AMEVIVE
,
a
decision
should
be
made
whether
to
discontinue
nursing
while
taking
the
drug
or
to
discontinue
the
use
of
the
drug
,
taking
into
account
the
importance
of
the
drug
to
the
mother
.
Geriatric
Use
Of
the
1357
patients
who
received
AMEVIVE
in
clinical
trials
,
a
total
of
100
patients
were
65
years
of
age
and
13
patients
were
75
years
of
age
.
No
differences
in
safety
or
efficacy
were
observed
between
older
and
younger
patients
,
but
there
were
not
sufficient
data
to
exclude
important
differences
.
Because
the
incidence
of
infections
and
certain
malignancies
is
higher
in
the
elderly
population
,
in
general
,
caution
should
be
used
in
treating
the
elderly
.
Pediatric
Use
The
safety
and
efficacy
of
AMEVIVE
in
pediatric

have
not
been

Because
of

Lansoprazole
is
metabolized
through

system
,
such
as
,
,

These
compounds
are
metabolized
through
various
cytochrome

isozymes
including

with
(
,
CYP3A
)
,
a
minor
increase
(
10
%
)
in
the
clearance
of

seen
.
Because
the
small
magnitude
and
the
direction
of
the
effect
on
clearance
,
this
interaction
is
unlikely
to
be
clinical
concern
.
Nonetheless
,
individual
patients
may
require
additional
titration
of
their
dosage
when
is
started
or
stopped
to
ensure
clinically
effective
blood
levels

also
been
shown
to
have
no
clinically
significant
interaction
with

concomitantly
with
1
gram

absorption
of

delayed
and
their
bioavailability
was
reduced
by
17
%
and
16
%
,
respectively
,
when
administered
concomitantly

its
effect
.
Lansoprazole
causes
a
profound
and
long
lasting
inhibition
of
gastric
acid

;
therefore
,
it
is
theoretically
possible
that

Non-steroidal
Anti-inflammatory
Drugs
:
In
some
patients
,
the
administration
of
a
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
agent
can
reduce
the
,
natriuretic
,
and
antihypertensive
effects
of
loop
,
potassium-sparing
and
thiazide
.
Therefore
,
when
and
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
agents
are
used
concomitantly
,
the
patient
should
be
observed
closely
to
determine
if
the
desired
effect
of
the
is
obtained

Beta-adrenergic
Blocking

Experience
in
over
1400
patients
in
a
non-comparative
clinical
trial
has
shown
that
concomitant
administration
of
and
agents
is
usually
well
tolerated

but
there
have
been
occasional
literature
reports
suggesting
that
the
combination
may
increase
the
likelihood
of

Effects
of
xanthine
derivatives
in
a
light/dark
test
in
mice
and
the
contribution
of
adenosine
receptors
.
We
investigated
the
effects
of
adenosine
antagonists
,
,
,
8-phenyltheophylline
,
and
8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine
(
DPCPX
)
,
in
a
light/dark
test
in
mice
.
All
antagonists
decreased
the
time
spent
in
the
light
zone
in
this
test
,
which
suggested
that
these
compounds
have
anxiogenic
effects
.
The
anxiogenic
effects
of
were
reduced
by
pretreatment
with
CGS
21680
,
an
A2-selective
agonist
,
but
not
by
N6-cyclopentyladenosine
(
CPA
)
,
an
A1-selective
agonist
.
However
,
the
antagonism
of
the
theophylline-induced
anxiogenic
effects
by
CGS21680
was
only
observed
in
the
time
spent
in
the
light
zone
,
and
DPCPX-induced
anxiogenic
effects
were
neither
reversed
by
CGS
21680
nor
by
CPA
.
Finally
,
it
is
notable
that
xanthine-derived
adenosine
antagonists
tested
here
commonly
showed
anxiogenic
effects
in
the
light/dark
test
in
mice
.
It
is
suggested
that
there
is
a
minor
contribution
of
adenosine
receptors
to
these
effects

although
theophylline-induced
anxiogenic
effects
were
antagonized
by
an

Interacts
with
valproic
acid
Since
entecavir
is
primarily
eliminated
by
the
kidneys
,
coadministration
of
BARACLUDE
with
that
reduce
renal
function
or
compete
for
active
tubular
secretion
may
increase
serum
concentrations
of
either
entecavir
or
the
coadministered
drug
.
Coadministration
of
entecavir
with
,
adefovir
dipivoxil
,
or
tenofovir
disoproxil
fumarate
did
not
result
in
significant
drug
interactions
.
The
effects
of
coadministration
of
BARACLUDE
with
other
that
are
renally
eliminated
or
are
known
to
affect
renal
function
have
not
been
evaluated

and
patients
should
be
monitored
closely
for
adverse

A
possible
interaction
has
been
suggested
with
hormonal
contraceptives
and
the
herbal
supplement
St.
Johns
Wort
based
on
some
reports
of
oral
contraceptive
users
experiencing
breakthrough
bleeding
shortly
after
starting
St.

.
Pregnancies
have
been
reported
by
users
of
combined
hormonal
contraceptives
who
also
used
some
form
of
St.

Healthcare
prescribers
are
advised

There
have
been
isolated
reports
of
patients

The
majority
of
these
reports
concerned
variable
elevations
in
prothrombin
times
without
clinically
significant
sequelae
.
Although
the
relevance
of
these

any
mechanism

The
mode
of
toxic
action
of
the
pesticide
gliftor
:
the
metabolism
of
1,3-difluoroacetone
to
(
-
)
-erythro-fluorocitrate
.
The
biochemical
toxicology
of
1,3-difluoroacetone
,
a
known
metabolite
of
the
major
ingredient
of
the
pesticide
Gliftor
(
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol
)
,
was
investigated
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.
Rat
kidney
homogenates
supplemented
with
coenzyme
A
,
ATP
,
oxaloacetate
,
and
Mg2+
converted
1,3-difluoroacetone
to
(
-
)
-erythro-fluorocitrate
in
vitro
.
Administration
of
1,3-difluoroacetone
(
100
mg
kg
(
-1
)
body
weight
)
to
rats
in
vivo
resulted
in
(
-
)
-erythro-fluorocitrate
synthesis
in
the
kidney
,
which
was
preceded
by
an
elevation
in
fluoride
levels
and
followed
by
citrate
accumulation
.
Animals
dosed
with
1,3-difluoroacetone
did
not
display
the
2-3
hour
lag
phase
in
either
(
-
)
-erythro-fluorocitrate
synthesis
or
in
citrate
and
fluoride
accumulation
characteristic
of
animals
dosed
with
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol
.
We
demonstrate
that
the
conversion
of
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol
to
1,3-difluoroacetone
by
an
NAD+-dependent
oxidation
is
the
rate-limiting
step
in
the
synthesis
of
the
toxic
product
,
(
-
)
-erythro-fluorocitrate
from
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol
.
Prior
administration
of
4-methylpyrazole
(
90
mg
kg
(
-1
)
body
weight
)
was
shown
to
prevent
the
conversion
of
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol
(
100
mg
kg
(
-1
)
body
weight
)
to
(
-
)
-erythro-fluorocitrate
in
vivo
and
to
eliminate
the
fluoride
and
citrate
elevations
seen
in
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol-intoxicated
animals
.
However
,
administration
of
4-methylpyrazole
(
90
mg
kg
(
-1
)
body
weight
)
to
rats
2
hours
prior
to
1,3-difluoroacetone
(
100
mg
kg
(
-1
)
body
weight
)
was
ineffective
in
preventing
(
-
)
-erythro-fluorocitrate
synthesis
and
did
not
diminish
fluoride
or
citrate
accumulation
in
vivo
.
We
conclude
that
the
prophylactic
and
antidotal
properties
of
4-methylpyrazole
seen
in
animals
treated
with
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol
derive
from
its
capacity
to
inhibit
the
NAD+-dependent
oxidation
responsible
for
converting
1,3-difluoro-2-propanol
to
1,3-difluoroacetone
in
the
committed
step
of
the
toxic
pathway

Spermine
promotes
the
translocation
of
phosphatidate
phosphohydrolase
from
the
cytosol
to
the
microsomal
fraction
of
rat
liver
and
it
enhances
the
effects
of
oleate
in
this
respect
.
Spermine
(
0.5-2
mM
)
promoted
the
translocation
of
phosphatidate
phosphohydrolase
from
the
soluble
to
the
microsomal
fraction
in
a
cell-free
system
derived
from
rat
liver
.
By
contrast
,
spermidine
(
1
mM
)
and
putrescine
(
1
mM
)
had
no
significant
effect
on
the
translocation
when
added
alone
.
Spermine
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
,
spermidine
,
enhanced
the
translocating
action
of
oleate
and
increased
its
effectiveness
in
transferring
the
phosphohydrolase
from
the
soluble
to
the
microsomal
fraction
.
It
is
proposed
that
the
phosphohydrolase
becomes
metabolically
active
when
it
combines
with
membranes
and
that
polyamines
might
help
to
regulate
this
interaction
.
This
could
facilitate
the
action
of
fatty
acids
and
enable
cells
to
increase
their
capacity
for
triacylglycerol
synthesis
to
match
an
increased
availability
of
fatty
acids
.
Elevated
plasma
levels
of
have
been
reported
with
concomitant
use
of
some
quinolones
.
There
have
been
reports
of
theophylline-related
side-effects
in
patients
on
concomitant
theophylline-quinolone
therapy
.
Therefore
,
monitoring
of
plasma
levels
should
be
considered
and
dosage
of
adjusted
as
required
.
Quinolones
have
also
been
shown
to
interfere
with
the
metabolism
of
.
This
may
lead
to
reduced
clearance
of
and
a
prolongation
of
its
plasma
half-life
.
Although
this
interaction
has
not
been
reported
with
cinoxacin
,
caution
should
be
exercised
when
cinoxacin
is
given
concomitantly
with
caffeine-containing
products
.
Antacids
or
substantially
interfere
with
the
absorption
of
some
quinolones
,
resulting
in
low
urine
levels

Also
,
concomitant
administration
of
quinolones
with
products
containing

multivitamins
containing
,
or
Videx
(
)
chewable/buffered
tablets
or
the
pediatric
powder
for
oral
solution
may
result
in
low
urine
levels
.
Quinolones
,
including
cinoxacin

may
enhance
the

its
derivatives
.
When
these
products

Intestinal
absorption
of
arsenate
in
the
chick
.
The
intestinal
absorption
of
arsenate
(
As
(
V
)
)
has
been
investigated
in
the
chick
by
means
of
the
in
situ
ligated
duodenal
loop
technique
.
By
this
procedure
,
it
was
observed
that
arsenate
is
rapidly
and
essentially
completely
absorbed
(
80-95
%
)
from
the
lumen
at
As
(
V
)
concentrations
up
to
5
mM
,
declining
to
about
50
%
absorption
at
50
mM
.
Transfer
from
the
intestinal
lumen
to
the
mucosal
cells
at
low
As
(
V
)
concentration
(
0.1
mM
)
is
rapid
,
while
transfer
from
the
mucosal
cells
to
the
body
occurs
more
slowly
.
At
stable
As
(
V
)
concentrations
greater
than
1
mM
,
fractional
mucosal
cell
accumulation
of
As
(
V
)
remains
constant
,
while
fractional
transfer
to
the
body
declines
.
However
,
total
mucosal
accumulation
of
As
(
V
)
and
that
transferred
to
the
body
increase
in
a
linear
logarithmic
fashion
from
0.05
to
5
mm
As
(
V
)
.
The
results
indicate
that
As
(
V
)
readily
penetrates
both
the
mucosal
and
serosal
surfaces
of
the
epithelial
membrane
.
Furthermore
,
arsenate
and
do
not
appear
to
share
a
common
transport
pathway
in
the
duodenum
and
no
evidence
was
obtained
for
any
interaction
between
the
two
at
this
level
.
Vitamin
D3
administration
to
rachitic
chicks
was
effective
in
significantly
elevating
duodenal
arsenate
absorption
,
acting
primarily
to
enhance
serosal
transport
.
The
effects
of
,
and
cocaine
on
bar-press
behavior
in
normal
and
genetically
nervous
dogs
.
Studies
on
two
strains
of
pointer
dogs
have
demonstrated
that
administration
of
a
benzodiazepine
(
)
facilitates
acquisition
of
goal-directed
behavior
in
``
genetically
nervous
''
subjects
.
Continued
admistration
of
the
drug
is
required
to
maintain
barpress
response
in
this
strain
of
dogs
.
The
concomitant
administration
of
either
cocaine
or
,
compounds
which
inhibit
neuronal
reuptake
of
,
disrupts
the
behavioral
response
of
the
genetically
nervous
E-strain
subjects
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
the
stable
A-strain
subjects
.
It
is
also
shown
that
after
14
days
of
daily
administration
of
,
withdrawal
of
the
drug
not
only
re-results
in
almost
complete
loss
of
bar-press
response
in
the
E-strain
subjects
but
also
results
in
a
temporary
decrease
in
the
acquired
behavioral
response
of
the
stable
A-strain
subjects
.
Clinical
implications
of
interactions
with
five
sedatives
.
The
intensity
,
uniformity
and
time
course
of
interference
by
,
secobarbital
,
,
chloral
hydrate
and
methaqualone
were
systematically
investigated
in
16
patients
receiving
coumarin
therapy
.
Each
subject
received
an
individualized
fixed
daily
dose
of
and
served
as
his
own
pre-
and
postsedative
treatment
control
.
Prothrombin
times
were
measured
four
times
weekly
during
five
long-term
experiments
.
Anticoagulant
inhibition
was
observed
during
the
administration
of
,
secobarbital
and
;
there
was
no
significant
change
in
prothrombin
test
results
during
the
trials
of
chloral
hydrate
and
methaqualone
.
Barbiturates
and
should
not
be
administered
to
patients
receiving
coumarin
.
The
concurrent
use
of
from
these
groups
is
decreasing
according
to
a
survey
of
200
hospital
medical
records
.
Chloral
hydrate
and
methaqualone
interact
pharmacologically
with
orally
administered
agents
,
but
the
effect
is
not
clinically
significant
.
It
is
concluded
that
chloral
hydrate
and
methaqualone
may
be
administered
safely
without
additional
caution
in
prothrombin
test
monitoring
during
oral
therapy
.
Paricalcitol

combination
was
studied
in
86
patients
with
hypertensive
disease
hospitalized
in
departments

[
Importance
of
pharmacogenetics
]
Pharmacogenetics
deals
with
the
differences
in
effect
of
caused
by
genetic
variation
.
Differences
can
occur
in
therapeutic
effect
and
in
adverse
events
.
Genetic
variation
in
metabolism
may
result
in
high
concentrations
of
and
an
increased
risk
of
adverse
effects
in
slow
metabolizers
,
which
is
important
when
using
for
example
antidepressants
or
chemotherapy
.
Genetic
variation
also
occurs
in
proteins
interacting
with
,
which
may
change
the
effect
of
e.g
.
asthma
and
antipsychotics
.
The
selection
of
and
their
dosages
may
be
improved
,
and
the
number
of
adverse
effects
reduced
by
pharmacogenetic
investigations
.
However
,
it
may
be
important
also
in
case
of
medical
examinations
for
insurances
and
job
appointments
,
since
some
patients
may
turn
out
to
need
expensive
or
to
be
susceptible
to
a
certain
disease
.
Therefore
,
the
use
of
genetic
data
in
these
instances
has
to
be
regulated
.
Diuretics

Tamoxifen
and

2D6
inhibitors
:
caution
.
Tamoxifen
,
an
estrogen
antagonist
,
is
the
standard
hormone
treatment
for
breast
cancer
.
It
is
extensively
transformed
into
its
active
metabolites
by
the
cytochrome
P450
enzyme
system
,
especially
into
endoxifen
by
isoenzyme
CYP
2D6
.
Co-administration
of
with
isoenzyme
CYP
2D6
inhibitors
reduces
this
metabolism
.
Selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
(
SSRI
)
antidepressants
inhibit
isoenzyme
CYP
2D6
.
and
reduce
the
plasma
concentration
of
endoxifen
by
about
50
%
.
Two
epidemiological
studies
involving
about
3700
women
have
shown
a
link
between
the
use
of
SSRI
antidepressants
and
an
increased
frequency
of
breast
cancer
recurrence
.
Other
studies
,
with
a
lower
level
of
evidence
,
were
less
convincing
.
Studies
of
other
isoenzyme
CYP
2D6
inhibitors
showed
no
increase
in
the
risk
of
breast
cancer
recurrence
,
but
they
lacked
statistical
power
.
It
is
better
to
avoid
prescribing
isoenzyme
CYP
2D6
inhibitors
to
women
treated
with
for
breast
cancer

not
exceed
7.5
mg
when
coadministered
with
potent

may
increase
the
frequency
and/or
severity
of
dry

Quantitative
approach
to

;
The
problems
encountered
during
the
longterm
treatment
of
psychotic
patients
with
neuroleptics
are
illustrated
by
six
typical
case
reports
.
A
group
of
patients
who
had
had
a
new
acute
episode
despite
seemingly
adequate
treatment
were
selected
.
In
these
six
cases
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
neuroleptics
dosage
was
inappropriate
,
being
either
too
high
or
too
low
as
judged
from
the
plasma
concentrations
.
Ways
of
improving
the
adequacy
of
the
treatment
of
psychotic
patients
with
neuroleptics
are
discussed
.
SKELAXIN
may
enhance
the
effects
of

,
the
following
may
interact
with

Allopurinol
:
Increased
possibility
of

particularly
in
hyperuricemic
patients
may
occur
.
Bacteriostatic
:
Chloramphenicol
,
erythromycins
,
sulfonamides
,
or
tetracyclines
may
interfere
with
the
bactericidal
effect
of
penicillins
.
This
has
been
demonstrated
in
view
,
however
,
the
clinical
significance
of
this

is
not
well
documented

The
development
of
clinical
vancomycin-resistant
strains
of
enterococci
(
VRE

is
a
major
cause
for
concern
.
Here
we
show
that
a
combination
of
galangin
or
3,7-dihydroxyflavone
with
vancomycin
may
be
used
to
sensitize
resistant

In
the
absence

Hematology
:
TAXOL
therapy
should
not
be
administered
to
patients
with
baseline
neutrophil
counts
of
less
than
1,500
cells/mm3
.
In
order
to
monitor
the
occurrence
of
myelotoxicity
,
it
is
recommended
that
frequent
peripheral
blood
cell
counts
be
performed
on
all
patients
receiving
TAXOL
.
Patients
should
not
be
re-treated
with
subsequent
cycles
of
TAXOL
until
neutrophils
recover
to
a
level
1500
cells/mm3
and
platelets
recover
to
a
level
100,000
cells/mm3
.
In
the
case
of
severe
neutropenia
(
500
cells/mm3
for
seven
days
or
more
)
during
a
course
of
TAXOL
therapy
,
a
20
%
reduction
in
dose
for
subsequent
courses
of
therapy
is
recommended
.
For
patients
with
advanced
HIV
disease
and
poor-risk
AIDS-related
Kaposi
s
sarcoma
,
TAXOL
,
at
the
recommended
dose
for

can
be
initiated
and
repeated
if
the
neutrophil
count
is
at
least
1000

Hypersensitivity
Reactions
:
Patients
with
a
history
of
severe
hypersensitivity
reactions
to
products
containing
Cremophor
EL
(
eg
,
for
injection
concentrate
and
for
injection
concentrate
)
should
not
be
treated
with
TAXOL
.
In
order
to
avoid
the
occurrence
of
severe
hypersensitivity
reactions
,
all
patients
treated
with
TAXOL
should
be
premedicated
with
corticosteroids
(
such
as
)
,
diphen-hydramine
and
H2
antagonists
(
such
as
or
)
.
Minor
symptoms
such
as
flushing
,
skin
reactions
,
dyspnea
,
hypotension
,
or
tachycardia
do
not
require
interruption
of
therapy
.
However
,
severe
reactions
,
such
as
hypotension
requiring
treatment
,
dyspnea
requiring
bronchodilators
,
angioedema
,
or
generalized
urticaria
require
immediate
discontinuation
of
TAXOL
and
aggressive
symptomatic
therapy
.
Patients
who
have
developed
severe
hypersensitivity
reactions
should
not
be
rechallenged
with
TAXOL
.
Cardiovascular
:
Hypotension
,
bradycardia
,
and
hypertension
have
been
observed
during
administration
of
TAXOL
,
but
generally
do
not
require
treatment
.
Occasionally
TAXOL
infusions
must
be
interrupted
or
discontinued
because
of
initial
or
recurrent
hypertension
.
Frequent
vital
sign
monitoring
,
particularly
during
the
first
hour
of
TAXOL
infusion
,
is
recommended
.
Continuous
cardiac
monitoring
is
not
required
except
for
patients
with
serious
conduction
abnormalities
.
Nervous
System
:
Although
the
occurrence
of
peripheral
neuropathy
is
frequent
,
the
development
of
severe
symptomatology
is
unusual
and
requires
a
dose
reduction
of
20
%
for
all
subsequentcourses
of
TAXOL
.
TAXOL

Hepatic
:
There
is
limited
evidence
that
the
myelotoxicity
of
TAXOL
may
be
exacerbated
in
patients
with

InjectionSite
Reaction
:
Injection
site
reactions
,
including
reactions
secondary
to
extravasation
,
were
usually
mild
and
consisted
of
erythema
,
tenderness
,
skin
discoloration
,
or
swelling
at
the
injection
site
.
These
reactions
have
been
observed
more
frequently
with
the
24-hour
infusion
than
with
the
3-hour
infusion
.
Recurrence
of
skin
reactions
at
a
site
of
previous
extravasation
following
administration
of
TAXOL
at
a
different
site
,
ie
,
recall
,
has
been
reported
rarely
.
Rare
reports
of
more
severe
events
such
as
phlebitis
,
cellulitis
,
induration
,
skin
exfoliation
,
necrosis
,
and
fibrosis
have
been
received
as
part
of
the
continuing
surveillance
of
TAXOL
safety
.
In
some
cases
the
onset
of
the
injection
site
reaction
either
occurred
during
a
prolonged
infusion
or
was
delayed
by
a
week
to
ten
days
.
A
specific
treatment
for
extravasation
reactions
is
unknown
at
this
time
.
Given
the
possibility
of
extravasation
,
it
is
advisable
to
closely
monitor
the
infusion
site
for
possible
infiltration
during
drug
administration

of
bombesin-enhanced
peritoneal
metastasis
of
intestinal
adenocarcinomas
induced

azoxymethane
in
wistar
rats
.
BACKGROUND
:
The
effects
of
combined
administration
of
bombesin
and
hydrochloride
(
)
,
a
channel
blocker
,
on
the
incidence
of
peritoneal
metastasis
of
intestinal
adenocarcinomas
induced
by
azoxymethane
(
AOM
)
and
the
labeling
index
of
intestinal
cancers
were
investigated
in
male
Wistar
rats
.
METHODS
:
From
the
beginning
of
the
experiment
,
rats
were
given
10
weekly
subcutaneous
injections
of
AOM
(
7.4
mg/kg
body
weight
)
and
subcutaneous
injections
of
bombesin
(
40
microg/kg
body
weight
)
every
other
day
,
and
from
week
16
,
intraperitoneal
injections
of
(
10
or
20
mg/kg
body
weight
)
every
other
day
until
the
end
fo
the
experiment
in
week
45
.
RESULTS
:
Bombesin
significantly
increased
the
incidence
of
intestinal
tumors
and
cancer
metastasis
to
the
peritoneum
.
Although
administered
at
either
dose
had
little
or
no
effect
on
the
enhancement
of
intestinal
carcinogenesis
by
bombesin
or
on
the
location
,
histologic
type
,
depth
of
involvement
,
labeling
index
,
apoptotic
index
or
tumor
vascularity
of
intestinal
cancers
,
it
significantly
decreased
the
incidence
of
cancer
metastasis
.
also
significantly
decreased
the
incidence
of
lymphatic
invasion
of
adenocarcinomas
,
which
was
enhanced
by
bombesin
.
CONCLUSION
:
These
findings
indicate
that
inhibits
cancer
metastasis
through
actions
that
do
not
affect
the
growth
of
intestinal
cancers
.
No
are
known
to
interfere
with
the
conversion
of
fosphenytoin
to
.
Conversion
could
be
affected
by
alterations
in
the
level
of
phosphatase
activity
,
but
given
the
abundance
and
wide
distribution
of
phosphatases
in
the
body
it
is
unlikely
that
would
affect
this
activity
enough
to
affect
conversion
of
fosphenytoin
to
.
Drugs
highly
bound
to
albumin
could
increase
the
unbound
fraction
of
fosphenytoin
.
Although
,
it
is
unknown
whether
this
could
result
in
clinically
significant
effects
,
caution
is
advised
when
administering
Cerebyx
with
other
that
significantly
bind
to
serum
albumin
.
The

Drugs
that
may
decrease
plasma

,
.
-
Drugs
that
may
either
increase
or
decrease
plasma
concentrations
include
:
,
vaiproic
acid
,
and
sodium
.
Similarly
,
the
effects
of
on
,
valproic
acid
and
sodium
plasma
concentrations
are
unpredictable
.
-
Although
not
a
true
drug
interaction
,
tricyclic
antidepressants
may
precipitate
seizures
in
susceptible
patients
and
Cerebyx
dosage
may
need
to
be
adjusted
.
-
Drugs
whose
efficacy
is
impaired
by
include
:
anticoagulants
,
corticosteroids
,
coumarin
,
,
doxycycline
,
estrogens
,
,
oral
contraceptives
,
,
,
,
vitamin

.
Monitoring
of
plasma
concentrations
may
be
helpful
when
possible
drug
interactions
are
suspected
.
Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions

It
may
also
produce

Tizoxanide
is
highly
bound
to
plasma

.
Therefore
,
caution
should
be
used
when
administering
nitazoxanide
concurrently
with
other
highly
plasma
protein-bound

narrow
therapeutic
indices
,
as
competition
for

sites
may
occur
(

.
In

metabolism
studies
have
demonstrated
that
tizoxanide
has
no
significant
inhibitory
effect
on
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
.
Although
no
drug-drug
interaction
studies
have
been
conducted
in

,
it
is
expected
that
no
significant
interaction
would
occur
when
nitazoxanide
is
co-administered
with
that
either
are
metabolized
by
or
inhibit
cytochrome

enzymes
.
No
formal
assessments
of
pharmacokinetic

Caution
is
advised
when

is
coadministered
with
other
medications
that
can
prolong
the

:
Long-term
suppression
of
gastric
acid
secretion
by
H2

Since
the
renal

Anakinra
:
Concurrent
administration
of
anakinra
(
an
interleukin-1
antagonist
)
and
another
TNF-blocking
agent
has
been
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of

,
an
increased
risk
of

The
safety
and
efficacy
of
anakinra
used
in

has
not
been
studied
.
Therefore
the
,
combination
of

Aminoglycosides
:
The
mixing
of
piperacillin
with
an
aminoglycoside
in

can
result
in
substantial
inactivation
of
the
aminoglycoside
.
Vecuronium
:
When
used
in
the
perioperative
period
,
piperacillin
has
been
implicated
in
the
prolongation
of
the
neuromuscular
blockade
of
vecuronium
.
Caution
is
indicated
when
piperacillin
is
used
perioperatively
.
In
one
controlled
clinical
study
,
the
ureidopenicillins
,
including
piperacillin
,
were
reported
to
prolong
the
action
of
vecuronium
.
Due
to
their
similar
mechanism
of
action
,
it
is
expected
that
the
neuromuscular
blockade
produced
by
any
of
the
non-depolarizing
muscle
relaxants
could
be
prolonged
in
the
presence
of
piperacillin
.
:
The
oral
combination
of
before
intramuscular
injection
of
PIPRACIL
produces
an
increase
in
piperacillin
peak
serum
level
of
about
30
%
.
:
Coagulation
parameters
should
be
tested
more
frequently
and
monitored
regularly
during
simultaneous
administration
of
high
doses
of
,
oral
anticoagulants
,
or
other
that
may
affect
the
blood
coagulation
system
or
the
thrombocyte
function
.
:
Piperacillin
sodium
may
reduce
the
excretion
of

Therefore
,
serum
levels
of

be
monitored
in
patients
to
avoid
drug
toxicity
.
Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions
As
with
other
penicillins
,
the
administration
of
PIPRACIL
may
result
in
a
false-positive
reaction
for
in
the
urine
using
a
copper-reduction
method
.
It
is
recommended
that
tests
based
on
enzymatic
oxidase
reactions
be
used
.
There
have
been
reports
of
positive
test
results
using
the
Bio-Rad
Laboratories
Platelia
Aspergillus
EIA
test
in
patients
receiving
piperacillin/tazobactam
injection
who
were
subsequently
found
to
be
free
of
Aspergillus
infection
.
Cross-reactions
with
non-Aspergillus
polysaccharides
and
polyfuranoses
with
the
Bio-Rad
Laboratories
Platelia
Aspergillus
EIA
test
have
been
reported
.
Therefore
,
positive
test
results
in
patients
receiving
piperacillin
should
be
interpreted
cautiously
and
confirmed
by
other
diagnostic
methods
.
Optimal
designs
for
the
individual
and
joint
exposure
general
logistic
regression
models
.
Interest
in
administering
compounds
in
combination
lies
both
in
enhancing
efficacious
effects
and
in
limiting
adverse
effects
.
Although
much
statistical
work
has
focused
on
developing
mathematical
functions
to
model
the
joint
dose-response
curves
,
relatively
little
work
exists
in
regard
to
designing
experiments
for
assessing
joint
action
.
A
variety
of
parametric
dose-response
models
based
on
either
the
normal
or
logistic
probability
distribution
have
been
proposed
in
the
literature
.
These
models
are
typically
nonlinear
in
the
parameters
,
and
as
such
,
a
nonlinear
weighted
least
squares
approach
can
be
employed
for
the
purpose
of
designing
experiments
.
The
approach
is
applicable
across
a
wide
variety
of
settings
commonly
associated
with
joint
action
data
,
including
continuous
and
discrete
responses
,
alternative
error
structures
,
and
nonzero
background
response
.
Further
,
designs
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
proportionate
responses
associated
with
the
individual
compounds
rather
than
dose
levels
,
thereby
providing
for
results
that
are
applicable
across
compounds
.
As
a
precursor
to
this
effort
,
optimal
and
minimal
experimental
designs
for
the
case
in
which
a
single
compound
is
administered
have
also
been
developed
.
Although
the
proposed
methodology
for
deriving
experimental
designs
can
be
applied
to
any
nonlinear
regression
model
,
primary
focus
is
given
to
the
additive
and
nonadditive
independent
joint
action
(
IJA
)
models
for
individual
and
combined
exposures
proposed
by
Barton

Anticholinergics
antagonize
the
effects
of
antiglaucoma
agents
.
Anticholinergic
in
the
presence
of
increased
intraocular
pressure
may
be
hazardous
when
taken
concurrently
with
agents
such
as
corti
costeroids
..
Anticholinergic
agents
may
affect
gastrointestinal
absorption
of
various
,
such
as
slowly
dissolving
dosage

increased
serum
concentrations
may
result

Anticholinergic
may
antagonize
the

,
such
as
.
Because
may
interfere
with
the
absorption
of
anticholinergic
agents
,
simultaneous
use
of
these
should
be
avoided
.
The
inhibiting
effects
of
anticholinergic
on
gastric
hydrochloric
acid
secretion
are
antagonized
by
agents
used
to
treat
achlorhydria
and
those
used

Drug
interaction
studies
with
decitabine
have
not
been
conducted
.
In
vitro
studies
in
human
liver
microsomes
suggest
that
decitabine
is
unlikely
to
inhibit
or
induce
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
.
In
vitro
metabolism
studies
have
suggested
that
decitabine
is
not
a
substrate
for
the
human
liver
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
.
As
plasma
protein
binding
of
decitabine
is
negligible
(
1
%
)
,
interactions
due
to
displacement
of
more
highly
protein
bound
from
plasma
proteins
are
not
expected
.
Interaction
of
the
constituents
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
the
promotion
of
liver
damage
.
Little
has
been
studied
of
the
adverse
effects
of
the
exposure
of
the
liver
to
the
interaction
of
with
its
congeners
and
acetaldehyde
,
coexisting
in
the
contents
of
alcoholic
beverages
.
Twenty
four
male
Wistar
rats
were
divided
into
four
groups
.
Two
groups
(
SH/DA
;
SH/FA
)
were
submitted
to
daily
treatment
with
synthetic
hydroalcoholic
solutions
containing
,
methanol
,
higher
alcohols
and
acetaldehyde
in
the
same
proportions
as
those
found
in
most
common
distilled
and
fermented
alcoholic
beverages
;
the
third
group
(
SH/EA
)
was
treated
with
a
hydroalcoholic
solution
of
;
the
fourth
group
served
as
control
and
received
an
equivalent
volume
of
an
isocaloric
solution
of
dextrose
.
All
the
animals
were
killed
at
the
end
of
the
9th
week
of
the
experiment
.
The
ratio
between
the
liver
weight
and
body
weight
was
found
to
be
lower
in
the
treated
animals
than
in
the
control
group
.
The
histology
of
the
liver
was
altered
in
the
three
groups
which
were
submitted
to
treatment
with
the
hydroalcoholic
solutions
,
with
quantitative
and
qualitative
differences
between
the
groups
.
These
results
suggest
that
the
hepatoxicity
of
in
alcoholic
beverages
is
enhanced
by
interaction
with
its
congeners
and
acetaldehyde
;
they
also
suggest
that
alcoholic
beverages
are
not
equivalent
in
their
potential
to
cause
liver
damage
.

in
combination
with
serotoninergic
agents
(
e.g.
,
,
,
,
,
venlafaxine
)
,
there
have
been
reports
of
serious
,
sometimes
fatal
,
reactions
.
Because
dexfenfluramine
is
a
serotonin
releaser
and
reuptake
inhibitor
,
dexfenfluramine
should
not
be
used
concomitantly
with
a
MAO
inhibitor
.
At
least
14
days
should
elapse
between
discontinuation
of
a
MAO
inhibitor
and
initiation
of
treatment
with
dexfenfluramine
.
At
least
3
weeks
should
elapse
between
discontinuation
of

MAO
inhibitor
.
A
rare
,
but
serious
,
constellation
of
symptoms
,
termed
serotonin
syndrome
,
has
been
reported
with
the
concomitant
use
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
and
agents
for
migraine
therapy
,
such
as
Imitrex
(
sumatriptan
succinate
)
and
.
The
syndrome
requires
immediate
medical
attention
and
may
include
one
or
more
of
the
following
symptoms
:

Dexfenfluramine
should
not
be
administered
with
other
serotoninergic
agents
.
The
appropriate
interval
between
administration
of
these
agents
and
dexfenfluramine
has
not
been
established
.
The
use
of
dexfenfluramine
with
other
CNS-active
has
not
been
systematically
evaluated
;
consequently
,
caution
is
advised
if
dexfenfluramine

Pre-treatment
with
the
inducer
decreased
erlotinib
AUC
by
about
2/3
.
Alternate
treatments
lacking

activity
should
be
considered
.
If
an
alternative
treatment
is
unavailable
,
a
TARCEVA
dose
greater
than
150
mg
should
be
considered
for
NSCLC
patients

and
greater
than
100
mg
considered
for
pancreatic
cancer
patients

If
the
TARCEVA
dose
is
adjusted
upward
,
the
dose
will
need
to
be
reduced

Hepatotoxicity
Asymptomatic
increases
in
liver
transaminases
have
been
observed
in
TARCEVA
treated
patients
;
therefore
,
periodic
liver
function
testing
(
transaminases
,
bilirubin

should
be
considered
.
Dose
reduction

should
be
considered
if
changes
in
liver
function
are
severe

Patients
with
Hepatic
Impairment
In
vitro
and
in
vivo
evidence
suggest
that
erlotinib
is
cleared
primarily
by
the
liver

erlotinib
exposure
may
be
increased
in
patients
with

It
is
possible
that
the
cardiovascular
action
of
other
channel
blockers
could
be
enhanced
by
the
addition
of
Nimotop
.
In
Europe
,
Nimotop
was
observed
to
occasionally
intensify
the
effect
of
antihypertensive
compounds
taken
concomitantly
by
patients
suffering
from
hypertension
;
this
phenomenon
was
not
observed
in
North
American
clinical
trials
.
A
study
in
eight
healthy
volunteers
has
shown
a
50
%
increase
in

nimodipine
plasma
concentrations
and
a
90
%
increase
in
mean
area
under

curve
,
after
a
one
week
course
of
at
1,000
mg/day
and
nimodipine
at
90
mg/day
.
This
effect
may
be
mediated
by
the
known
inhibition
of
hepatic
cytochrome
P-
450
by
,
which
could
decrease
first

OBJECTIVE
:
Our
objective
was
to
characterize
the
steady-state
pharmacokinetics
of
everolimus

(
INN
,
ciclosporin
)
when
coadministered
in
de
novo
kidney
allograft
recipients
during
the
first
year
after
transplantation
.
METHOD
:
This
study
was
a
multicenter
randomized
double-blind
study
of
101
patients
who
were
randomly
assigned
1:1:1
to
receive
everolimus
tablets
at
doses
of
0.5
mg
,
1
mg
,
or
2
mg
twice
daily
with

.
Blood
sampling
for
the
pharmacokinetics
of

and
was
performed
on
day

3
,
and
4
,
and
on
months
2
,
3
,
6
,
9
,
and

.
Everolimus
dose-proportionality
and
stability
over
time
were
assessed
in
the
context
of
linear
regression
and
ANOVA
models
.
Everolimus
exposure-response
relationships
between
area
under
the
blood
concentration-time
curve
(
AUC
)
and
changes
in
platelets
,
leukocytes
,
and
lipids
were
explored
with
the
median-effect
model
.
Potential
differences
in
dosing
and
pharmacokinetics
at
different
levels
of
everolimus
exposure
were
assessed
in
the
context
of
ANOVA
.
RESULTS
:
Everolimus
steady
state
was
reached
on
or
before
day
7
,
with
a
median
3-fold
accumulation
of
drug
exposure
compared
with
that
after
the
first
postoperative
dose
.
Both
steady-state
maximum
concentration
and
AUC
were
dose
proportional
over
the
full
dose
range
when
assessed
on
day
1
,
as
well
as
for
the
full
duration
of
the
study
at
steady
state
.
There
was
evidence
for
longitudinal
stability
in
AUC
of
everolimus
during
the
course
of
the
study
.
The
interindividual
pharmacokinetic
variability
for
AUC
was
85.4

CONCLUSIONS
:
Everolimus
exhibited

Cholinergic
role
in
's
effects
on
evoked
potentials
in
visual
cortex
of
the
albino
rat
.
Photic
evoked
potentials
were
recorded
from
the
visual
cortex
of
chronically
implanted
albino
rats
.
Since
photic
evoked
potential
components
are
representations
of
neural
pathways
which
are
activated
during
photic
stimulation
,
study
of
the
effects
of
on
these
components
may
help
to
trace
pathways
which
are
affected
by
.
In
the
present
study
,
evoked
potentials
were
recorded
at
5
,
20
,
and
40
min
following
IP
injections
of
saline
,
(
2.0
g/kg
)
,
(
0.6
mg/kg
)
or
(
15.0
mg/kg
)
on
separate
days
.
Ethanol
depressed
the
amplitudes
of
most
evoked
potential
components
in
comparison
to
saline
administration
.
Component
P2
,
however
,
was
increased
in
amplitude
.
Physostigmine
briefly
reduced
the
amplitude
of
most
components
,
including
P2
.
In
contrast
,
increased
the
amplitudes
of
components
P1
and
P2
,
while
decreasing
components
N1
,
N2
and
N3
for
varying
durations
of
time
.
Physostigmine
pretreatment
augmented
the
depressant
effect
of
on
the
early
components
P1
and
N1
,
while
attenuating
's
influence
on
components
P2
and
P3
.
Pretreatment
with
likewise
further
reduced
the
amplitudes
of
components
P1
and
N1
,
and
produced
a
similar
effect
on
component
N3
.
Atropine
,
either
alone
or
in
combination
with
,
produced
approximately
the
same
degree
of
enhancement
of
component
P2
.
In
comparison
to
saline
values
,
all
three
agents
produced
reliable
increases
in
peak
latency
for
most
of
the
components
,
with
only
N3
showing
no
effects
.
The
amplitude
data
from
this
study
suggest
that
's
augmentation
of
component
P2
may
result
,
at
least
in
part
,
from
alterations
in
cholinergic
functions
.
Thiabendazole
may
compete
with
other
,
such
as
,
for
sites
of
metabolism
in
the
liver
,
thus
elevating
the
serum
levels
of
such
compounds
to
potentially
toxic
levels
.
Therefore
,
when
concomitant
use
of
thiabendazole
and
xanthine
derivatives
is
anticipated
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
monitor
blood
levels
and/or
reduce
the
dosage
of
such
compounds
.
Such
concomitant
use
should
be
administered
under
careful
medical
supervision
.

System
is
metabolized
mainly
via
the

,
therefore
potential
interactions
may
occur
when
DURAGESIC
is
given
concurrently
with
agents
that
affect
activity
.
Coadminstration
with
agents
that
induce

may
reduce
the
efficacy
of
DURAGESIC

The
concomitant
use
of

potent
3A4

such
as
,
,
,
,
,
and
may
result
in
an
increase
in

.
The
concomitant
use
of
other
inhibitors
such
as
and
with
transdermal
may
also
result
in
an
increase
in
plasma
concentrations
,
which
could
increase
or
prolong
adverse
drug
effects
and
may
cause
serious
respiratory
depression
.
In
this
situation
,
special
patient
care
and
observation
are
appropriate
.

and
,
may
cause
respiratory

or
potentially
result
in

or
death
.
When
such
combined
therapy
is
contemplated
,
the
dose
of
one
or
both
agents
should
be
significantly
reduced
.
MAO
Inhibitors
:
DURAGESIC
is
not
recommended
for
use
in
patients
who
have
received
MAOI
within
14
days
because
severe
and
unpredictable
potentiation
by
MAO
inhibitors
has
been
reported
with
opioid
analgesics
.
No
formal

.
Patients
who
are
concomitantly
receiving
VELCADE
and
that
are
inhibitors
or
inducers
of
cytochrome

3A4
should
be
closely
monitored
for
either

or
reduced
efficacy
.
During
clinical
trials
,
hypoglycemia
and
hyperglycemia
were
reported
in
diabetic
patients
receiving

Patients
on

As
a
moderate
inhibitor
of

aprepitant
can
increase
plasma
concentrations
of
coadministered
medicinal
products
that
are
metabolized
through
.
Aprepitant
has
been
shown
to
induce
the
metabolism
of
S
(

and
,
which
are

.
Coadministration
of
Aprepitant
with
these
or
other
that
are
known
to
be
metabolized
by
,
such
as
,
may
result
in
lower

.
Aprepitant
is
unlikely
to
interact
with
that
are

as
demonstrated
by
the
lack
of

therefore
,
the
efficacy

be
reduced
.
Although
a

with
oral
contraceptives
has
not
been
studied
,
alternative

2C9
,
2C19
,
2D6

3A4
,
and
3E1
)
was
0-16

Since
fondaparinux
does
not
markedly
inhibit
CYP450s
(
,
CYP2A6
,
,
CYP2C19
,
,
CYP2E1
,
or
)
in

,
fondaparinux
sodium
is
not
expected
to
significantly
interact
with
other
in
vivo
by
inhibition
of
metabolism
mediated
by
these
isozymes
.
Since
fondaparinux
sodium
does
not
bind
significantly
to
plasma
proteins
other
than
ATIII
,
no
drug
interactions
by
protein-binding
displacement
are
expected
.
In
vitro
,
nilutamide
has
been
shown
to
inhibit
the
activity
of
liver
cytochrome
P-450
isoenzymes
and
therefore
,
may
reduce
the
metabolism
of
compounds
requiring
these
systems
.
Consequently
,
with
a
low
therapeutic
margin
,
such
as
vitamin
K
antagonists
,
,
and
,
could
have
a
delayed
elimination
and
increases
in
their
serum
half-life
leading
to
a
toxic
level
.
The
dosage
of
these
or
others
with
a
similar
metabolism
may
need
to
be
modified
if
they
are
administered
concomitantly
with
nilutamide
.
For
example
,
when
vitamin
K
antagonists
are
administered
concomitantly
with
nilutamide
,
prothrombin
time
should
be
carefully
monitored
and
if
necessary
,
the
dosage
of
vitamin
K
antagonists
should
be
reduced

Cypermethrin-induced
oxidative
stress
in

Considering
that
the
involvement
of
reactive
species
(
ROS
)
has
been
implicated
in
the
toxicity
of
various
pesticides
,
this
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
oxidative
stress
induction
by
cypermethrin
,
a
Type
II
pyrethroid
.
Either
single
(
170
mg/kg
)
or
repeated
(
75
mg/kg
per
day
for
5
days
)
oral
administration
of
cypermethrin
was
found
to
produce
significant
oxidative
stress
in
cerebral
and
hepatic
tissues
of
rats
,
as
was
evident
by
the
elevation
of
the
level
of
thiobarbituric
acid
reactive
substances
(
TBARS
)
in
both
tissues
,
either
4
or
24
h
after
treatment
.
Much
higher
changes
were
observed
in
liver
,
increasing
from
a
level
of
60
%
at
4
h
up
to
nearly
4
times
the
control
at
24
h
for
single
dose
.
Reduced
levels
(
up
to
20
%
)
of
total
glutathione
(
total
GSH
)
,
and
elevation
of
conjugated
dienes
(
approximately
60
%
in
liver
by
single
dose
at
4
h
)
also
indicated
the
presence
of
an
oxidative
insult
.
Glutathione-S-transferase
(
GST
)
activity
,
however
,
did
not
differ
from
control
values
for
any
dose
or
at
any
time
point
in
cerebral
and
hepatic
tissues
.
Pretreatment
of
rats
with
allopurinol
(
100
mg/kg
,
ip
)
or
Vitamin
E
(
100
mg/kg
per
day
,
ig
,
for
3
days
and
a
dose
of
40
mg/kg
on
the
4th
day
)
provided
significant
protection
against
the
elevation
of
TBARS
levels
in
cerebral
and
hepatic
tissues
,
induced
by
single
high
dose
of
oral
cypermethrin
administration
within
4
h
.
Thus
,
the
results
suggest
that
cypermethrin
exposure
of
rats
results
in
free
radical-mediated
tissue
damage
,
as
indicated
by
elevated
cerebral
and
hepatic
lipid
peroxidation
,
which
was
prevented
by
allopurinol
and
Vitamin

Effects
of
low

sympathetic
nerves
.
The
effect
of
temperature
changes
on
the
number
of
microtubules
in
non-myelinated
axons
has
been
studied
in
cat
inferior
mesenteric
ganglion/hypogastric
nerve
preparations
incubated
at
various
temperatures
in
Eagles
minimal
essential
tissue
culture
medium
in

.
At
37
degrees
C
the
non-myelinated
axons
contained
28.4
plus
or
minus
0.8
S.E.M
.
(
54
)
microtubules
per
axon
.
After
incubation
at
0
degrees
C
for
4
h
this
number
fell
to
2.3
plus
or
minus
0.1
S.E.M
.
(
41
)
but
returned
to
normal
levels
when
the
nerves
were
rewarmed
.
This
loss
of
microtubules
on
cooling
the
nerves
and
their
reappearance
on
rewarming
was
a
rapid
process
;
it
was
independent
of
the
influence
of
the
nueronal
cell
body
and
of
protein
synthesis
within
the
axon
.
The
preservation
of
the
microtubules
was
improved
when
D2O
was
present
in
the
incubation
medium
.
Reformed
microtubules
appeared
to
function
normally
with
respect
to
their
possible
role
in
the
transport
of
storage
vesicles
along
the
axons

Finasteride
had
no

,
no
clinically
meaningful
changes
in
luteinizing

(
LH
)
,
follicle-stimulating
hormone
(
FSH

In
healthy
volunteers
,
treatment
with
finasteride
did
not
alter
the
response
of
LH
and
FSH
to
gonadotropin-releasing
hormone
indicating
that
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular
axis
was
not
affected
.
In
clinical
studies
with
PROPECIA
(
finasteride
,
1
mg
)
in
men
18-41
years
of
age
,
the
mean
value
of
serum
prostate-specific
antigen
(
PSA
)
decreased
from
0.7
ng/mL
at
baseline
to
0.5

.
Further
,
in
clinical
studies
with
PROSCAR
(
finasteride
,
5
mg

when
used
in
older
men
who
have
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
,
PSA
levels
are
decreased
by
approximately
50
%

These
findings
should
be
taken
into
account
for
proper
interpretation
of
serum
PSA
when
evaluating
men
treated
with
finasteride

Since
MEXITIL
is
a
substrate
for
the
metabolic
pathways
involving
and
enzymes
,
inhibition
or
induction
of
either
of
these
enzymes
would
be
expected
to
alter
mexiletine
plasma
concentrations
.
In
a
formal
,
single-dose
interaction
study
(
n
=
6
males
)
the
clearance
of

decreased
by
38
%
following
the

,
coadministration
of

not
alter
the

group
.
However
,
the
metabolic
clearance
of
mexiletine
in
the
extensive
metabolizer
phenotype
decreased
by
about
70
%
making
the
poor
and
extensive
metabolizer
groups
indistinguishable
.
In
this
crossover
steady
state
study
,
the
pharmacokinetics
of
were
unaffected
in
either
phenotype
by
the
coadministration
of
mexiletine
.
Addition
of

not
lead
to
further
electrocardiographic
parameters

of
QRS

When
concomitant
administration
of
either
of
these
two
with
mexiletine
is
initiated
,
the
dose
of
mexiletine
should
be
slowly
titrated
to
desired
effect
.

There
has
been
concern
about
the
interaction
between
vitamin
B12
and
folic
acid
.
Folic
acid
supplements
can
correct
the
anemia
associated
with
vitamin
B12
deficiency
.
Unfortunately
,
folic
acid
will
not
correct
changes
in
the
nervous
system
that
result
from
vitamin
B12
deficiency
.
Permanent
nerve
damage
could
theoretically
occur
if
vitamin
B12
deficiency
is
not
treated
.
Therefore
,
intake
of
supplemental
folic
acid
should
not
exceed
1000
micrograms
(
g
,
sometimes
mcg
)
per
day
to
prevent
folic
acid
from
masking
symptoms
of
vitamin
B12
deficiency
.
It
is
important
for
older
adults
to
be
aware
of
the
relationship
between
folic
acid
and
vitamin
B12
because
they
are
at
greater
risk
of
having
a
vitamin
B12
deficiency
.
If
you
are
50
years
of
age
or
older
,
ask
your
physician
to
check
your
B12
status
before
you
take
a
supplement
that
contains
folic

Two
weeks
later
,
retinal
flatmounts
were
examined
for

.
Without
the
addition
of
enzymes
,
transduction
was
limited
to
occasional
cells
in
the
retinal
ganglion
cell
layer
.
The
addition
of
heparinase
III
or
chondroitin
ABC
lyase
greatly
enhanced
transduction
of
the
retinal
ganglion
cell
layer
and
increased
the
depth
of

into
the
outer

.
Hyaluronan
lyase
had
a
limited
effect
and
collagenase
was
ineffective

Electroretinograms
survived
with
higher
concentrations
of
heparinase
III
and
chondroitin
ABC
lyase
than
were
required
for
optimal
retinal
transduction
.
AAV2-mediated
retinal
transduction
is
improved
by
co-injection
of
heparinase
III
or
chondroitin

efficiency
may
allow
intravitreal

to
become
the
preferred
route
for

abruptly
toxic
when
given
one
of
these
inhibiting
as
concomitant
therapy
.
The
that
inhibit
cytochrome
P450
2D6
include
some
that
are
not
metabolized
by
the
enzyme
(
;
)
and
many
that
are
substrates
for
P450
2D6
(
many
other
antidepressants
,
phenothiazines
,
and
the
Type
1C
antiarrhythmics
and
)
.
While
all
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
e.
g.
,
,
,
and
,
inhibit
P450
2D6
,
they
may
vary
in
the
extent
of
inhibition
.
The
extent
to
which
SSRI-TCA
interactions
may
pose
clinical
problems
will
depend
on
the
degree
of
inhibition
,
and
the
pharmacokinetics
of
the
SSRI
involved
.
Nevertheless
,
caution
is
indicated
in
the
co-administration
of
TCA5
with
any
of
the
SSRIs
and
also
in
switching
from
one
class
to
the
other
.
Of
particular
importance
,
sufficient
time
must
elapse
before
initiating
TCA
treatment
in
a
patient
being
withdrawn
from
,
given
the
long
half-life
of
the
parent
and
active
metabolite
(
at
least
5
weeks
may
be
necessary
)
.
Concomitant
use
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
with
that
can
inhibit
cytochrome
P450
2D6
may
require
lower
doses
than
usually
prescribed
for
either
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
or
the
other
drug
.
Furthermore
,
whenever
one
of
these
other
is
withdrawn
from
cotherapy
,
an
increased
dose
of
tricyclic
antidepressant
may
be
required
.
It
is
desirable
to
monitor
TCA
plasma
levels
whenever
a
TCA
is
going
to
be
co-administered
with
another
drug
known
to
be
an
inhibitor
of
P450
2D6
.
Concurrent
use
of
butorphanol
with
central
nervous
system
depressants
(
e.g.
,
,
barbiturates
,
tranquilizers
,
and
)
may
result
in
increased
central
nervous
system
depressant
effects
.
When
used
concurrently
with
such
,
the
dose
of
butorphanol
should
be
the
smallest
effective
dose
and
the
frequency
of
dosing
reduced
as
much
as
possible
when
administered
concomitantly
with
that
potentiate
the
action
of
opioids
.
In
healthy
volunteers
,
the
pharmacokinetics
of
a
1-mg
dose
of
butorphanol
administered
as
STADOL
NS
were
not
affected
by
the
coadministration
of
a
single
6-mg
subcutaneous
dose
of
sumatriptan
.
However
,
in
another
study
in
healthy
volunteers
,
the
pharmacokinetics
of
butorphanol
were
significantly
altered
(
29
%
decrease
in
AUC
and
38
%
decrease
in
Cmax
)
when
a
1-mg
dose
of
STADOL
NS
was
administered
1
minute
after
a
20-mg
dose
of
sumatriptan
nasal
spray
.
(
The
two
were
administered
in
opposite
nostrils
.
)
When
the
STADOL
NS
was
administered
30
minutes
after
the
sumatriptan
nasal
spray
,
the
AUC
of
butorphanol
increased
11
%
and
Cmax
decreased
18
%
.
In
neither
case
were
the
pharmacokinetics
of
sumatriptan
affected
by
coadministration
with
STADOL
NS
.
These
results
suggest
that
the
analgesic
effect
of
STADOL
NS
may
be
diminished
when
it
is
administered
shortly
after
sumatriptan
nasal
spray
,
but
by
30
minutes
any
such
reduction
in
effect
should
be
minimal
.
The
safety
of
using
STADOL
NS
and
IMITREX
(
sumatriptan
)
Nasal
Spray
during
the
same
episode
of
migraine
has
not
been
established
.
However
,
it
should
be
noted
that
both
products
are
capable
of
producing
transient
increases
in
blood
pressure
.
The
pharmacokinetics
of
a
1-mg
dose
of
butorphanol
administered
as
STADOL
NS
were
not
affected
by
the
coadministration
of
(
300
mg
QID
)
.
Conversely
,
the
administration
of
STADOL
NS
(
1
mg
butorphanol
QID
)
did
not
alter
the
pharmacokinetics
of
a
300-mg
dose
of
.
It
is
not
known
if
the
effects
of
butorphanol
are
altered
by
concomitant
medications
that
affect
hepatic
metabolism
of
(
,
etc
.
)
,
but
physicians
should
be
alert
to
the
possibility
that
a
smaller
initial
dose
and
longer
intervals
between
doses
may
be
needed
.
The
fraction
of
STADOL
NS
absorbed
is
unaffected
by
the
concomitant
administration
of
a
nasal
vasoconstrictor
(
oxymetazoline
)
,
but
the
rate
of
absorption
is
decreased
.
Therefore
,
a
slower
onset
can
be
anticipated
if
STADOL
NS
is
administered
concomitantly
with
,
or
immediately
following
,
a
nasal
vasoconstrictor
.
No
information
is
available
about
the
use
of
butorphanol
concurrently
with
MAO
inhibitors
.
There
is
usually
complete
cross-resistance
between
PURINETHOL
(
mercaptopurine
)
and
TABLOID
brand
Thioguanine
.
As
there
is
in
vitro
evidence
that
aminosalicylate
derivatives
(
e.g.
,
olsalazine
,
mesalazine
,
or
)
inhibit
the
TPMT
enzyme
,
they
should
be
administered
with
caution
to
patients
receiving
concurrent
thioguanine
therapy

Oral
:
Thyroid
hormones
appear
to
increase
catabolism
of

If
oral
anticoagulants
are
also
being
given

therapy
should
be
watched
very
closely
when

If
a

it
is
likely
that
a
reduction
in
dosage
will
be
required

Estrogen
,
Oral
Contraceptives
:
Estrogens
tend
to
increase
serum
thyroxine-binding
globulin
(
TBg
)
.
In
a
patient
with
a
nonfunctioning
thyroid
gland
who
is
receiving
thyroid
replacement
therapy
,
free

be
decreased
when
estrogens
are
started
thus
increasing
thyroid
requirements
.
However
,
if
the
patients
thyroid
gland
has
sufficient
function
,
the
decreased
free

result
in
a
compensatory
increase
in
output
by
the
thyroid
.
Therefore
,
patients
without
a
functioning
thyroid
gland
who
are
on

therapy
may
need
to
increase
their
thyroid
dose
if

Use
with
caution
and
be
prepared
to
treat

,
if
necessary

Vasopressors
:
Thyroxine
increases
the
adrenergic
effect
of
catecholamines
such
as
and
.
Therefore
,
injection
of
these
agents
into
patients
receiving
thyroid

condition
after
11
weeks
of

Ergot-Containing
Drugs
:
These

.
Because
there
is
a

and
other
potent
inhibitors
(
e.g.
,

Diuretics
:
Patients
on
,
especially
those
with
intravascular
volume
depletion
,
may
occasionally
experience
an
excessive
reduction
of
blood
pressure
after
initiation
of
therapy
with
fosinopril
sodium
.
The
possibility
of
hypotensive
effects
can
be
minimized
by
either
discontinuing
the
or
increasing
salt
intake
prior
to
initiation
of
treatment
with
fosinopril
sodium
.
If
this
is
not
possible
,
the
starting
dose
should
be
reduced
and
the
patient
should
be
observed
closely
for
several
hours
following
an
initial
dose
and
until
blood
pressure
has
stabilized
(
see
DOSAGE
AND
ADMINISTRATION

)
Supplements
and
Potassium-Sparing
Diuretics
:
Fosinopril
sodium
can
attenuate
loss
caused
by
thiazide
.
Potassium-sparing
(
,
,
,
and
others
)
or
supplements
can
increase
the
risk
of
hyperkalemia
.
Therefore
,
if
concomitant
use
of
such
agents
is
indicated
,
they
should
be
given
with
caution
,
and
the
patients
serum
should
be
monitored
frequently
.
:
Increased
serum
levels
and
symptoms
of
toxicity
have
been
reported
in
patients
receiving
ACE
inhibitors
during

These
should
be
coadministered
with
caution
,
and
frequent
monitoring
of
serum
levels
is
recommended
.
If
a

also
used
,
the
risk
of

may
be
increased
.
Antacids
:
In

clinical
pharmacology
study
,
coadministration
of
an
antacid
(
hydroxide
,
hydroxide
,
and
simethicone
)
with
fosinopril
reduced
serum
levels
and
urinary
excretion
of
fosinoprilat
as
compared
with
fosinopril
administered
alone
,
suggesting
that
may
impair
absorption
of
fosinopril
.
Therefore
,
if
concomitant
administration
of
these
agents
is
indicated
,
dosing
should
be
separated
by
2
hours

was
significantly
reduced
in
both
groups
(
ie
,
from
901
mL/h
to
318
mL/h
in
the
group
that
received
150
mg
of

day
and
from
723
mL/h
to
457
mL/h
in
the
group
that
received
75
mg
of

day
)
.
Thus
there
was
a
tendency
toward
a
more
pronounced
inhibition
of
the
4-hydroxylation
during
treatment
with
150
mg/d
of

with
75

the

was
not
statistically
significant

CONCLUSION
:
Fluvoxamine
is
a
moderate
inhibitor
of
in
vivo
.
Although
the
pressor
activity
of
Desmopressin
is
very
low
compared
to
its
antidiuretic
activity
,
large
doses
of
Desmopressin
Tablets
should
be
used
with
other
pressor
agents
only
with
careful
patient
monitoring
.
Differential
regulation
of
tyrosine
phosphorylation
in
tumor
cells
by
contortrostatin
,
a
homodimeric
disintegrin
,
and
monomeric
disintegrins
echistatin
and
flavoridin
.
The
homodimeric
disintegrin
contortrostatin
was
compared
directly
to
the
monomeric
disintegrins
echistatin
and
flavoridin
for
the
ability
to
affect
protein
tyrosine
phosphorylation
in
tumor
cells
.
It
was
observed
that
contortrostatin
had
a
dramatic
effect
on
the
tyrosine
phosphorylation
status
of
several
proteins
in
T24
human
bladder
cancer
cells
,
including
robust
induction
of
phosphorylation
of
proteins
in
the
range
of
120-140
kDa
.
Echistatin
alone
had
no
effect
on
tyrosine
phosphorylation
in
T24
cells
,
but
dose-dependently
inhibits
the
effects
of
contortrostatin
when
both
are
added
simultaneously
.
Among
the
proteins
that
undergo
tyrosine
phosphorylation
in
response
to
contortrostatin
treatment
is
CAS
,
a
130
kDa
adapter
protein
involved
in
integrin
signaling
.
Flavoridin
alone
was
found
to
have
no
effect
on
CAS
,
but
can
completely
block
contortrostatin-induced
phosphorylation
of
this
protein
in
MDA-MB-435
cells
.
These
observations
strongly
suggest
that
the
homodimeric
structure
of
contortrostatin
functionally
distinguishes
it
from
other
monomeric
members
of
the
disintegrin
family
.

Studies
with
forced

of
Bcl-2

suggest
that
dasatinib-mediated
induction
of
p27
(

enhanced
paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis
by
negatively
regulating
Bcl-2
and

Inhibition
of

To
minimize
CNS
depression
and
possible
potentiation
,
barbiturates
,
,
narcotics
,
hypotensive
agents
or
phenothiazines
should
be
used
with
caution
.
Ethyl

A
further
phenomenon
of
toxicity
common
to
many
hydrazine
derivatives
is
hemolysis
and
the
appearance
of
Heinz-Ehrlich
inclusion
bodies
in
erythrocytes
.
No
cross-resistance
with
other
chemotherapeutic
agents
,
radiotherapy
or
steroids
has
been
demonstrated
.
Both
and
its
major
metabolite
,
hydroxyitraconazole
,
are
inhibitors
of
the
cytochrome
P450
3A4
enzyme
system
.
Coadministration
of
and
primarily
metabolized
by
the
cytochrome
P450
3A4
enzyme
system
may
result
in
increased
plasma
concentrations
of

could
increase
or
prolong
both
therapeutic
and
adverse
effects
.
Therefore
,
unless
otherwise
specified
,
appropriate
dosage
adjustments
may
be
necessary
.
Coadministration

led
to
elevated

resulting
in
rare
instances
of

threatening
cardiac
dysrhythmias

in
elevated
plasma
concentrations
of

its
active
metabolite

Based
on
the
chemical
resemblance

data
indicate
that
oral

Data
suggest
that

In

suggest
that

therefore
concomitant

contraindicated
.
Coadministration
of

resulted
in
elevated
plasma

of
the
latter
two

This
may
potentiate
and
prolong

.
These

should
not
be
used
in
patients
treated

If
is
administered
parenterally
,
special
precaution
is
required
since
the
sedative

may
be
prolonged
.
Coadministration
of
and
,
or
has
led
to
increased
plasma
concentrations
of
the
latter
three
.
,
and
concentrations
should
be
monitored
at

Potential
for
INVEGA
to
Affect
Other
Drugs
Paliperidone
is
not
expected
to
cause
clinically
important
pharmacokinetic
interactions
with
that
are
metabolized
by
cytochrome
P450
isozymes
.
In
vitro
studies
in
human
liver
microsomes
showed
that
paliperidone
does
not
substantially
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
metabolized
by
cytochrome
P450
isozymes
,
including
,
CYP2A6
,
CYP2C8/9/10
,
,
CYP2E1
,
,
and
CYP3A5
.
Therefore
,
paliperidone
is
not
expected
to
inhibit
clearance
of
that
are
metabolized
by
these
metabolic
pathways
in
a
clinically
relevant
manner
.
Paliperidone
is
also
not
expected
to
have
enzyme
inducing
properties
.
At
therapeutic
concentrations
,
paliperidone
did
not
inhibit
P-glycoprotein
.
Paliperidone
is
therefore
not
expected
to
inhibit
P-glycoprotein-mediated
transport
of
other
in
a
clinically
relevant
manner
.
Given
the
primary
CNS
effects
of
paliperidone
,
INVEGA
should
be
used
with
caution
in
combination
with
other
centrally
acting
and
.
Paliperidone
may
antagonize
the
effect
of
and
other
agonists
.
Because
of
its
potential
for
inducing
orthostatic
hypotension
,
an
additive
effect
may
be
observed
when
INVEGA
is
administered
with
other
therapeutic
agents
that
have
this
potential
.
Potential
for
Other
Drugs
to
Affect
INVEGA
Paliperidone
is
not
a
substrate
of
,
CYP2A6
,
,
and
CYP2C19
,
so
that
an
interaction
with
inhibitors
or
inducers
of
these
isozymes
is
unlikely
.
While
in
vitro
studies
indicate
that
and
may
be
minimally
involved
in
paliperidone
metabolism
,
in
vivo
studies
do
not
show
decreased
elimination
by
these
isozymes
and
they
contribute
to
only
a
small
fraction
of
total
body
clearance
.

cefditoren
pivoxil
had
no
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics

Although
the
clinical
significance

,
as
evidenced

antagonists
.
:
As
with
other
b-lactam
antibiotics
,
co-administration

Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions
Cephalosporins
are
known
to
occasionally
induce
a
positive
direct
Coombs
test
.
A
false-positive
reaction
for
in
the
urine
may
occur
with
copper
reduction
tests
(
Benedicts

or
with
CLINITEST
tablets
)
,
but
not
with
enzyme-based
tests
for
glycosuria
(
e.g.
,
CLINISTIX
,
TES-TAPE
)
.
As
a
false-negative
result
may
occur
in
the
ferricyanide
test
,
it
is
recommended
that
either
the
oxidase

Behavioral
mechanisms
underlying
the
link
between
smoking
and
drinking
.
Many
people
use
both
and
(
i.e.
,
cigarettes
and
other
tobacco
products
)
.
The
behavioral
effects
of
these
two
differ
,
and
they
do
not
act
on
the
same
target
sites
in
the
brain
,
although
they
may
share
,
or
partly
share
,
certain
properties
.
The
initiation
of
or
use
may
be
precipitated
by
similar
personality
characteristics
in
the
user
,
such
as
impulsivity
and
sensation
seeking
.
Moreover
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
development
of
dependence
may
be
similar
for
and
.
Thus
,
certain
factors
,
such
as
reinforcing
drug
effects
,
conditioning
processes
,
automatic
behavior
,
and
stress
,
may
influence
the
development
of
dependence
on
both
.
Other
factors
,
such
as
tolerance
and
sensitization
to
the
'
actions
and
the
development
of
withdrawal
symptoms
,
may
also
contribute
to
dependence
.
This
review
discusses
the
actions
of
the
two
on
certain
brain
chemical
(
i.e.
,
neurotransmitter
)
systems
and
the
extent
to
which
the
effects
of
the
two
may
interact
.
Atovaquone
is
highly
bound
to
plasma
protein
(
99.9
%
)
.
Therefore
,
caution
should
be
used
when
administering
MEPRON
concurrently
with
other
highly
plasma
protein-
bound
with
narrow
therapeutic
indices
,
as
competition
for
binding
sites
may
occur
.
The
extent
of
plasma
protein
binding
of
atovaquone
in
human
plasma
is
not
affected
by
the
presence
of

nor
is
the

by
the

:
Coadministration
of

results
in
a
significant

The
clinical

and
whether
similar

will
occur
in
patients
given

is
unknown
;
no
other

Products

,
or
given
with
to
patients
with

Because
candesartan

not
significantly
metabolized
by
the
cytochrome

system
and
at
therapeutic
concentrations
has
no
effects
on

Patients

receive
initial

greater
than
one-tenth
(
1/10

This
interaction
appears
to
be
related
both
to
pressor

to
beta-adrenergic

Therefore
,
EXTREME
CAUTION
should
be
exercised
when
administering

to
patients
receiving
cyclopropane

It
has
been
reported
that

The
concomitant
use

also
showed
good
inhibition
,
while
gallic
acid

Drugs
with
ototoxic
potential
:
Especially
in
the
presence
of
impaired
renal
function
,
the
use
of
parenterally
administered
bumetanide
in
patients
to
whom
aminoglycoside
antibiotics
are
also
being
given
should
be
avoided
,
except
in
life-threatening
conditions
.
-
Drugs
with
nephrotoxic
potential
:
There
has
been
no
experience
on
the
concurrent
use
of
bumetanide
with
known
to
have
a
nephrotoxic
potential
.
Therefore
,
the
simultaneous
administration
of
these
should
be
avoided
.
-
:
should
generally
not
be
given
with
(
such
as
bumetanide
)
because
they
reduce
its
renal
clearance
and
add
a
high
risk
of
toxicity
.
-
:
Pretreatment
with
reduces
both
the
natriuresis
and
hyperreninemia
produced
by
bumetanide
.
This
antagonistic
effect
of
on
bumetanide
natriuresis
is
not
due
to
a
direct
action
on
sodium
excretion
but
is
probably
secondary
to
its
inhibitory
effect
on
renal
tubular
secretion
of
bumetanide
.
Thus
,
should
not
be
administered
concurrently
with
bumetanide
.
-
:
blunts
the
increases
in
urine
volume
and
sodium
excretion
seen
during
bumetanide
treatment
and
inhibits
the
bumetanide-induced
increase
in
plasma
renin
activity
.
Concurrent
therapy
with
bumetanide
is
thus
not
recommended
.
-
:
Bumetanide
may
potentiate
the
effect
of
various
antihypertensive
,
necessitating
a
reduction
in
the
dosage
of
these
.
-
:
Interaction
studies
in
humans
have
shown
no
effect
on
blood
levels

:
Interaction
studies
in
humans
have
shown
bumetanide
to
have
no
effect
on

prothrombin
activity
.
Anticholinesterases
:
Concurrent
use
of
hydrochloride
and
anticholinesterase
agents
may
result
in
increased
systemic
toxicity
since
anticholinesterases
inhibit
the
breakdown
of
hydrochloride
.
Antimyasthenics
Concurrent
use
of
hydrochloride
and
antimyasthenics
may
result
in
loss
of
control
of
symptoms
of
myasthenia
gravis
due
to
antagonism
of
the
effects
of
antimyasthenics
on
skeletal
muscle
.
Temporary
dosage
adjustment
of
antimyasthenics
may
be
required
.
Also
antimyasthenics
may
have
anticholinesterase
activity
.
CNS
depressant
medications
:
Concurrent
use
of
hydrochloride
and
CNS
depressant
medications
may
result
in
additive
depressant
effects
.
Hyaluronidase
:
Hyaluronidase
may
increase
the
diffusion
rate
of
hydrochloride
,
resulting
in
a
decreased
time
of
onset
,
but
an
increase
in
systemic
toxicity
.
Neuromuscular
blocking
agents
(
such
as
suxamethonium
chloride
)
:
Concurrent
use
of
hydrochloride
and
neuromuscular
blocking
agents
may
result
in
prolongation
or
enhancement
of
the
neuromuscular
blockade
.
Sulfonamides
:
Concurrent
use
of
hydrochloride
and
sulfonamides
may
result
in
a
reduction
of
the
antibacterial
action
of
the
sulfonamide
.
Acetazolamide

Concurrent
use
of
acetazolamide
and

Diagnostic
,
treatment
and
aftercare
approaches
to
cocaine
abuse
.
The
general
public
feels
that
cocaine
is
not
particularly
dangerous
because
it
does
not
produce
a
well
defined
physical
dependency
and
abstinence
syndrome
.
However
,
when
addiction
is
defined
as
compulsion
,
loss
of
control
and
continued
use
in
spite
of
adverse
consequences
,
cocaine
drug
hunger
can
be
seen
as
an
agent
of
addictive
disease
.
Withdrawal
from
cocaine
dependence
usually
involves
depression
,
anxiety
and
lethargy
.
These
usually
clear
within
a
week
,
leaving
only
the
``
drug
hunger
''
to
contend
with
.
Medication
is
rarely
needed
.
When
cocaine
is
the
primary
addiction
,
after
withdrawal
the
most
effective
treatment
is
group
therapy
with
other
recovering
cocaine
abusers
.
We
incorporate
the
principles
of
recovery
and
define
positive
and
constructive
alternatives
in
dealing
with
cocaine
hunger
.
Recovery
programs
should
be
flexible
and
involve
individual
and
family
education
on
recovery
and
the
nature
of
addictive
disease
.
Exercise
that
produces
cardiopulmonary
stimulation
is
a
helpful
means
of
reducing
drug
hunger
and
anxiety
during
recovery
therapy
.
In
vitro
studies
have
shown
CASODEX
can
displace
coumarin
anticoagulants
,
such
as
,
from
their
protein-binding
sites
.
It
is
recommended
that
if
CASODEX
is
started
in
patients
already
receiving
coumarin
anticoagulants
,
prothrombin
times
should
be
closely
monitored
and
adjustment
of
the
dose
may
be
necessary
.
No
formal

is
an
aminoglycoside
antibiotic
used
to
treat
a
wide
variety
of
infections
caused
by
gram-negative
organisms
,
but
it
is
potentially
toxic
to
the
kidneys
.
Due
to
its
nephrotoxicity
,
may
cause
abnormal
renal
uptake
to
be
seen
on
99mTc-MDP
bone
scintigraphy
.
The
presence
of
the
radiopharmaceutical
in
the
kidneys
,
along
with
an
increase
in
renal
retention
,
tend
to
produce
scintigraphic
results
that
falsely
identify
characteristics
related
to
diseases
such
as
renal
vascular
,
or
urinary
tract
obstruction
,
and
even
renal
cancer
.
An
altered
biodistribution
may
provide
misleading
information
that
can
either
mask
or
mimic
certain
disease
symptoms
.
A
method
to
maximize
the
therapeutic
benefit
of
while
minimizing
the
risk
of
nephrotoxicity
and
the
appearance
of
a
hot
kidney
on
scintigraphy
is
desirable
.
Serial
pharmacokinetic
dosing
has
been
proposed
as
a
method
to
accomplish
this
goal
.
Therapeutic
drug
monitoring
(
TDM
)
of
therapy
,
and
bone
scintigraphy
employing
99mTc-MDP
as
the
radiopharmaceutical
was
carried
out
in
22
patients
.
The
data
presented
here
demonstrate
that
with
serial
pharmacokinetic
dosing
of
,
the
iatrogenic
alteration
caused
by
therapy
can
be
avoided
.
As
DIFFERIN
Gel
has
the
potential
to
produce
local
irritation
in
some
patients
,
concomitant
use
of
other
potentially
irritating
topical
products
(
medicated
or
abrasive
soaps
and
cleansers
,
soaps
and
cosmetics
that
have
a
strong
drying
effect
,
and
products
with
high
concentrations
of
,
astringents
,
spices
or
lime
)
should
be
approached
with
caution
.
Particular
caution
should
be
exercised
in
using
preparations
containing
sulfur
,
,
or
salicylic
acid
in
combination
with
DIFFERIN
Gel
.
If
these
preparations
have
been
used
it
is
advisable
not
to
start
therapy
with
DIFFERIN
Gel
until
the
effects
of
such
preparations
in
the
skin
have
subsided
.
An
inhibitor
of
CYP2C8
(
such
as
)
may
increase
the
AUC
of
rosiglitazone
and
an
inducer
of
CYP2C8
(
such
as
)
may
decrease
the
AUC
of
rosiglitazone
.
Therefore
,
if
an
inhibitor
or
an
inducer
of
CYP2C8
is
started
or
stopped
during
treatment
with
rosiglitazone
,
changes
in
diabetes
treatment
may
be
needed
based
upon
clinical
response
.
Taking
a
rauwolfia
alkaloid
while
you
are
taking
or
within
2
weeks
of

may
increase
the

of
central

system
depression
or
may
cause
a
severe
high
blood
pressure
reaction
.
Specific
drug
interaction
studies
have
not
been
conducted
with
ENBREL
.
However
,
it
was
observed
that
the
pharmacokinetics
of
ENBREL
was
unaltered
by
concomitant
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
patients
.
In
a
study
in
which
patients
with
active
RA
were
treated
for
up
to
24
weeks
with
concurrent
ENBREL
and
anakinra
therapy
,
a
7
%
rate
of
serious
infections
was
observed
,
which
was
higher
than
that
observed
with
ENBREL
alone
(
0
%
)
.
Two
percent
of
patients
treated
concurrently
with
ENBREL
and
anakinra
developed
neutropenia
(
ANC
1
x
109/L
)
.
Patients
in
a
clinical
study
who
were
on
established
therapy
with
,
to
which
ENBREL
was
added
,
were
noted
to
develop
a
mild
decrease
in
mean
neutrophil
counts
in
comparison
to
groups
treated
with
either
ENBREL

The
clinical

of
this
observation

Analgesic
effects
of
antihistaminics
.
The
literature
provides
considerable
evidence
indicating
that
several
,
but
not
all
antihistaminics
,
are
indeed
analgesic
agents
and
some
are
analgesic
adjuvants
as
well
.
Those
for
which
effectiveness
is
reported
includes
diphenhydramine
,
,
orphenadrine
,
pyrilamine
,
phenyltoloxamine
,
,
methdilazine
,
and
tripelennamine
.
The
proposed
mechanisms
of
analgesic
action
of
antihistaminics
are
reviewed
and
discussed
.
The
literature
suggests
that
more
than
one
mechanism
of
action
exists
for
them
.
There
is
considerable
evidence
suggesting
that
histaminergic
and
serotoninergic
central
pathways
are
involved
in
nociception
and
that
antihistaminic
can
modulate
their
responses
(

)
.
The
evidence
for
a
role
for
and
and
the
effects
of
antihistaminics
on
them
are
less
well
established
.
Still
other
pathways
have
been
proposed
.
A
greater
understanding
of
pain
mechanisms
will
aid
in
elucidating
the
role
of
antihistaminics
in
analgesia
.
Supplements/Antacids
Products
containing
and
other
multivalent
cations
(
such
as
,
,
)
are
likely
to
interfere
with
absorption
of
Ibandronate
.
Ibandronate
should
be
taken
at
least
60
minutes
before
any
oral
medications
containing
multivalent
cations
(
including
,
supplements
or
vitamins
)
.
H2
Blockers
and
Proton
Pump
Inhibitors
(
PPIs
)
Of
over
3500
patients
enrolled
in
the
Ibandronate
osteoporosis
Treatment
and
Prevention
Studies
,
15
%
used
anti-peptic
agents
(
primarily
H2
blockers
and
PPIs
)
.
Among
these
patients
,
the
incidence
of
upper
gastrointestinal
adverse
experiences
in
the
patients
treated
with
Ibandronate
was
similar
to
that
in
placebo-treated
patients
.
Similarly
,
of
over
1600
patients
enrolled
in
a
study
comparing
once-monthly
with
daily
dosing
regimens
of
ibandronate
,
14
%
of
patients
used
anti-peptic
agents
.
Among
these
patients
,
the
incidence
of
upper
gastrointestinal
adverse
experiences
in
the
patients
treated
with
Ibandronate
150
mg
once
monthly
was
similar
to
that
in
patients
treated
with
Ibandronate
2.5
mg
once
daily
.
Aspirin/Nonsteroidal
Antiinflammatory
Drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
In
the
large
,
placebo-controlled
osteoporosis
Treatment
Study
,
and
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
were
taken
by
62
%
of
the
2946
patients
.
Among
or
NSAID
users
,
the
incidence
of
upper
gastrointestinal
adverse
events
in
patients
treated
with
ibandronate
2.5
mg
daily
(
28.9
%
)
was
similar
to
that
in
placebo-treated
patients
(
30.7
%
)
.
Similarly
,
in
the
1-year
monthly
comparison
study
,
and
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
were
taken
by
39
%
of
the
1602
patients
.
The
incidence
of
upper
gastrointestinal
events
in
patients
concomitantly
taking
or
NSAIDs
was
similar
in
patients
taking
ibandronate
2.5
mg
daily
(
21.7
%
)
and
150
mg
once
monthly
(
22.0
%
)
.
However
,
since
,
NSAIDs
,
and
bisphosphonates
are
all
associated
with
gastrointestinal
irritation
,
caution
should
be
exercised
in
the
concomitant
use
of
or
NSAIDs
with
Ibandronate
.
Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions
Bisphosphonates
are
known
to
interfere
with
the

have
not
been
performed

:
In
a
prospective
study
involving
six-healthy-male
volunteers
,
dirithromycin
did
not
affect
the

These
six
volunteers
received
alone
(
60
mg
twice
daily
)
for
8
days

with
dirithromycin
(
500
mg
once

The
pharmacokinetics
of

and
the
electrocardiographic
QT
c

were
measured
during
both
periods
:
with
alone

and
with
plus
dirithromycin
.
In
five
men

levels
were
undetectable
(
5
ng/mL
)
throughout
the
study
;
in
one
man
,
the
C
max
of

.
The
mean
C

,
T
max
,
and
AUC
of
the
acid

not
significantly
changed
.
The
mean
QT
c

(
msec
)
was
369
with
alone

367
with
plus
dirithromycin
.
Also
,
in

experiments
demonstrated
a
lack
of
interaction
between
dirithromycin
and

Thus
,
the
interaction
observed
between
and
is
not
expected
for
dirithromycin

Serious
cardiac
dysrhythmias
,
some
resulting
in
death
,
have
occurred
in
patients
receiving
concomitantly

Following
co-administration
of
two
250-mg
dirithromycin
tablets
administered
once
daily
with
200-mg
tablets
administered
twice
daily
for
10
days
to
14
healthy
subjects
,
the
steady-state
plasma
concentration
of
was
not
significantly
altered
.
In
general
,
most
patients
treated
with
dirithromycin
who
are
receiving
concomitant
therapy
may
not
require
empiric
adjustment
of
dosage
or
monitoring
of
plasma
concentrations
.
However
,
plasma
concentrations
should
be
monitored
,
with
dosage
adjustment
as
appropriate
,
in
patients
whose
pulmonary
disease
requires
maintaining
a
given
plasma
concentration
for
optimal
pulmonary
function
or
in
patients
with
concentrations
at
the
higher
end
of
the
therapeutic
range

antagonists
:
When
dirithromycin
is
administered
immediately
following
or
H
2

antagonists
,
the
absorption
of
dirithromycin
is
slightly
enhanced
.
The
following
drug
interactions
have
been
reported
with
products
.
It
is
presently
not
known
whether
these

drug
interactions
occur
with
dirithromycin
.
Until
further
data
are
available
regarding
the
potential
interaction
of
dirithromycin
with
these
compounds
,
caution
should
be
used
during
coadministration
.
Triazolam

Ergotamine
:
Concurrent

The
risk
of
using
mesylate
in
combination
with
other
has
not
been
systematically
evaluated
,
but
may
potentiate
the
side
effects
of

Compounds
in
these
categories
result
in
a
decreased
efficacy
of
mesylate
:
phenothiazines

Concomitant
use
of
mesylate
with
other
ergot

is
not
recommended
.
Specific

interaction
studies
have
not
been
conducted
with
Levofloxacin

However
,
the
systemic
administration
of
some
quinolones

interfere
with
the
metabolism
of

were
obtained
from

study
of
Neurontin
in
epileptic
patients
(
N=8

gabapentin
had
no

Coadministration
(
N=18
)
of
sodium
capsules
(
250
mg
)
with
Neurontin
(
125
mg
)
appears
to
increase
the
amount
of
gabapentin
absorbed
by
12
%
to
15
%
.
Gabapentin
had
no

Hydrocodone
:
Coadministration
of
Neurontin
(
125
to
500
mg
;
N=48
)
decreases
hydrocodone
(
10
mg
;
N=50
)
Cmax
and
AUC
values
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
relative
to
administration
of
hydrocodone
alone
;
Cmax
and
AUC
values
are
3
%
to
4
%
lower
,
respectively
,
after
administration
of
125
mg
Neurontin
and
21
%
to
22
%
lower
,
respectively
,
after
administration
of
500

The
mechanism
for
this

Hydrocodone
increases
gabapentin
AUC
values
by
14
%
.
The
magnitude
of
interaction
at
other
doses
is
not
known
.
:
A
literature
article
reported
that
when
a
60-mg
controlled-release
capsule
was
administered
2
hours
prior
to
a
600-mg
Neurontin
capsule
(
N=12
)
,
mean
gabapentin
AUC
increased
by
44
%
compared
to
gabapentin
administered
without

pharmacokinetic
parameter
values
were
not
affected
by
administration
of
Neurontin
2
hours
after
.
The
magnitude
of
interaction
at
other
doses
is
not
known
.
:
In
the
presence
of
at
300
mg
QID
(
N=12
)
the
mean
apparent
oral
clearance
of
gabapentin
fell
by
14
%
and
creatinine
clearance
fell
by
10
%
.
Thus
appeared
to
alter
the
renal
excretion
of
both
gabapentin
and
creatinine
,
an
endogenous
marker
of
renal
function
.
This
small
decrease
in
excretion
of
gabapentin
by
is
not
expected
to
be
of
clinical
importance
.
The
effect
of
gabapentin
on
was
not
evaluated
.
Oral
Contraceptive
:
Based
on
AUC
and
half-life
,
multiple-dose
pharmacokinetic
profiles
of
and
ethinyl
following
administration
of
tablets
containing
2.5
mg
of
acetate
and
50
mcg
of
ethinyl
were
similar
with
and
without
coadministration
of
gabapentin
(
400
mg
TID
;
N=13
)
.
The
Cmax
of
was
13
%
higher
when
it
was
coadministered
with
gabapentin
;
this
interaction
is
not
expected
to
be
of
clinical
importance
.
Antacid
(
Maalox
)
:
Maalox
reduced
the
bioavailability
of
gabapentin
(
N=16
)
by
about
20
%
.
This
decrease
in
bioavailability
was
about
5
%
when
gabapentin
was
administered
2
hours
after
Maalox
.
It
is
recommended
that
gabapentin
be
taken
at
least
2
hours
following
Maalox
administration
.
Effect
of
:
is
a
blocker
of
renal
tubular
secretion
.
Gabapentin
pharmacokinetic
parameters
without
and
with
were
comparable
.
This
indicates
that
gabapentin
does
not
undergo
renal
tubular
secretion
by
the
pathway
that
is
blocked
by
.
Drug/Laboratory
Tests
Interactions
Because
false
positive
readings
were
reported
with
the
Ames
N-Multistix
SG
dipstick
test
for
urinary
protein
when
gabapentin
was
added
to
other
antiepileptic
,
the
more
specific
sulfosalicylic
acid
precipitation
procedure
is
recommended
to
determine
the
presence
of
urine
protein
.
Physiological
changes
resulting
from
smoking
cessation
,
with
or
without
replacement
,
may
alter
the
pharmacokinetics
of
certain
concomitant
medications
,
such
as
tricyclic
antidepressants
and
.
Doses
of
these
and
perhaps
other
medications
may
need
to
be
adjusted
in
patients
who
successfully
quit
smoking
.
Results
from
human
in
vitro
metabolism
studies
and
nonclinical
studies
show
that
REVLIMID
(
lenalidomide
)
is
neither
metabolized
by
nor
inhibits
or
induces
the
cytochrome
P450
pathway
suggesting
that
lenalidomide
is
not
likely
to
cause
or
be
subject
to
P450-based
metabolic
drug
interactions
in
man
.
Co-administration
of
multiple
doses
of
10
mg
of
lenalidomide
had
no
effect
on
the
single
dose
pharmacokinetics
of
R-
and
S-
.
Co-administration
of
single
25-mg
dose
had
no
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
total
lenalidomide
.
Expected
changes
in
laboratory
assessments
of
PT
and
INR
were
observed
after
administration
,
but
these
changes
were
not
affected
by
concomitant
lenalidomide
administration
.
The
potential
for
increased
sedation
when
guanfacine
is
given
with
other
CNS-depressant
drug
should
be
appreciated
.
The
administration
of
guanfacine
concomitantly
with
known
microsomal
enzyme
inducer
(
or
)
to
two
patients
with
renal
impairment
reportedly
resulted
in
significant
reductions
in
elimination
half-life
and
plasma
concentration
.
In
such
cases
,
therefore
,
more
frequent
dosing
may
be
required
to
achieve
or
maintain
the
desired
hypotensive
response
.
Further
,
if
guanfacine
is
to
be
discontinued
in
such
patients
,
careful
tapering
of
the
dosage
may
be
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
rebound
phenomena
.
TCAs
decrease
the
hypotensive
effect
of
guanfacine
.
Noncardioselective
beta-blockers
(
nadolol
,
porpranolol
,
timolol
)
may
exacerbate
rebound
hypertension
when
guanfacine
is
withdrawn
.
The
beta-blocker
should
be
withdrawn
first
.
The
gradual
withdrawal
of
guafacine
or
a
cardioselective
beta-blocker
could
be
substituted
.

Ten
patients
who
were
stabilized
on
oral
anticoagulants
were

guanfacine
,
1-2
mg/day

No
changes
were
observed
in
the
degree
of
anticoagulation
.
In
several
well-controlled
studies
,
guanfacine
was
administered
together
with
with
no
drug
interactions
reported
.
In
the
long-term
safety
studies

Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions
No

related
to
the
use
of
guanfacine
have
been
identified
.
Interactions
between
Leukine
and

have
not
been
fully
evaluated
.
Drugs
which
may
potentiate
the
myeloproliferative

,
should
be
used
with
caution

Based
on
in
vitro
studies
in
human
liver
microsomes
,
des-ciclesonide
appears
to
have
no
inhibitory
or
induction
potential
on
the
metabolism
of
other
metabolized
by
CYP
450
enzymes
.
The
inhibitory
potential
of
ciclesonide
on
CYP450
isoenzymes
has
not
been
studied
.
In
vitro
studies
demonstrated
that
the
plasma
protein
binding
of
des-ciclesonide
was
not
affected
by
or
salicylic
acid
,
indicating
no
potential
for
protein
binding-based
drug
interactions
.
In
a
drug
interaction
study
,
co-administration
of
orally
inhaled
ciclesonide
and
oral
,
an
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450
3A4
,
had
no
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
either
des-ciclesonide
or
.
In
another
drug
interaction
study
,
co-administration
of
orally
inhaled
ciclesonide
and
oral
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450
3A4
,
increased
the
exposure
(
AUC
)
of
des-ciclesonide
by
approximately
3.6-fold
at
steady
state
,
while
levels
of
ciclesonide
remained
unchanged
.
Therefore
,
should
be
administered
with
caution
with

Monoamine
Oxidase
Inhibition
:
Linezolid
is
a
reversible
,
nonselective
inhibitor
of
monoamine
oxidase
.
Therefore
,
linezolid
has
the
potential
for
interaction
with
adrenergic
and
serotonergic
agents
.
Adrenergic
Agents
:
Some
individuals
receiving
ZYVOX
may
experience
a
reversible
enhancement
of
the
pressor
response
to
indirect-acting
sympathomimetic
agents
,
vasopressor
or
dopaminergic
agents

Commonly
used
such
as
and
have
been
specifically
studied
.
Initial
doses
of
adrenergic
agents
,
such
as
or
,
should
be
reduced
and
titrated
to
achieve
the
desired
response
.
Serotonergic
Agents
:
Co-administration
of
linezolid
and
serotonergic
agents
was
not
associated
with
serotonin
syndrome
in
Phase
1
,
2
or
3
studies
.
Spontaneous
reports
of
serotonin
syndrome
associated
with
co-administration
of
ZYVOX
and
serotonergic
agents
,
including
antidepressants
such
as
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
have
been
reported
.
Patients
who
are
treated
with
ZYVOX
and
concomitant
serotonergic
agents
should
be
closely
observed
for
signs
and
symptoms
of
serotonin
syndrome
(
e.g.
,
cognitive
dysfunction
,
hyperpyrexia
,
hyperreflexia
,
incoordination
)
.
If
any
signs
or
symptoms
occur
physicians
should
consider
discontinuation
of
either
one
or
both
agents
(
ZYVOX
or
concomitant
serotonergic
agents

single-dose
interaction
study
in
NIDDM

,
decreases
in
AUC

The
single-dose
nature
of
this

and
the
lack
of

makes
the

Interaction
on
the
antinociceptive
effect
between
neurotensin
and
enkephalins
or
tuftsin
.
The
aim
of
this
paper
was
to
study
the
interaction
between
neurotensin
and
both
enkephalins
or
its
synthetic
analogue
D-Ala2-metenkephalinamide
,
or
tuftsin
,
on
the
antinonciceptive
effect
of
these
peptides
in
mice
after
intracisternal
injection
.
Antinociception
was
measured
by
the
hot-plate
method
.
It
was
shown
that
neurotensin
antagonized
evidently
the
antinociceptive
effect
of
enkephalins
and
their
analogue
.
On
the
contrary
,
neurotensin
and
tuftsin
were
agonists
in
induction
of
analgesia
.
It
is
concluded
that
neurotensin
modulates
in
an
opposite
way
the
function
of
the
enkephalinergic
neurons
and
the
central
action
of
tuftsin
.
Although
clinical
studies
have
not
established
a
cause
and
effect
relationship
,
physicians
should
be
aware
that
variable
effects

been
reported
very
rarely
in
patients
receiving
oral
anticoagulants

The
concomitant
use

system
depressants

competes
with
meropenem
for
active
tubular
secretion
and
thus
inhibits
the
renal
excretion
of
meropenem
.
This
led
to
statistically
significant
increases
in
the
elimination
half-life
(
38
%
)
and
in
the
extent
of
systemic
exposure
(
56
%
)
.
Therefore
,
the
coadministration
of
with
meropenem
is
not
recommended
.
There
is
evidence
that
meropenem
may
reduce
serum
levels
of
valproic
acid
to
subtherapeutic
levels
(
therapeutic
range
considered
to
be
50
to
100

Methyprylon
may
interact
with
other
addictive
medications
,
in
that
it
may
increase
the
likelyhood
of
addiction

Concurrent
use
of

other
CNS
depression-producing

increase
the
CNS
depressant
effects
of
methyprylon

these
other
medications

While
co-administration
of
ZAVESCA
appeared
to
increase
the
clearance
of
Cerezyme
by
70
%

these
results
are
not
conclusive
because
of
the
small
number
of
subjects
studied

because
patients
took
variable
doses
of

dissolution
of
aerosol
particles
of
budesonide
in
Survanta
,
a
model
lung
surfactant
.
The
effect
of
a
pulmonary
surfactant
extract
from
bovine
lung
,
Survanta
,
on
the
dissolution
rate
of
aerosol
particles
of
budesonide
was
determined
.
Aerosol
particles
of
budesonide
were
generated
from
an
solution
,
dried
,
and
collected
by
a
cascade
impactor
for
characterization
or
by
a
liquid
impinger
for
dissolution
experiments
.
Powder
x-ray
diffraction
,
differential
scanning
calorimetry
,
differential
thermal
analysis
,
and
scanning
electron
microscopy
were
used
to
characterize
the
aerosol
particles
and
starting
material
.
No
change
in
phase
was
detected
,
although
the
aerosol
particles
appeared
to
contain
residual
solvent
.
The
dissolution
rate
of
the
aerosol
particles
in
saline
was
low
and
variable
.
Survanta
increased
the
extent
of
dissolution
of
budesonide
in
proportion
to
the
added
concentration
,
which
was
also
verified
by
equilibrium
solubilization
studies
.
Survanta
also
increased
rate
of
dissolution
,
in
a
manner
similar
to
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate
.
Analysis
of
the
concentration
of
budesonide
following
ultracentrifugation
indicated
that
there
is
rapid
equilibration
of
budesonide
between
the
Survanta
and
aqueous
phase
.
These
results
show
that
lung
surfactant
has
the
potential
of
enhancing
the
rate
and
extent
of
dissolution
of
administered
to
the
lung
.
Steady-state
serum
concentrations
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
are
reported
to
fluctuate
significantly
when

Serious
anticholinergic
symptoms
(
severe
dry

)
have
been
associated
with
elevations
in
the
serum
levels
of
tricyclic

In
addition
,
higher-than
expected
steady-state
serum
concentrations
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
have
been
observed
when

In
well-controlled

undergoing
concurrent
therapy
with

a
decrease
in
the

The
therapeutic
efficacy
of
tricyclic

may
be
compromised
in
these
patients
when
is
discontinued

Several
of
the
tricyclic
antidepressants
have
been
cited
in
these
reports
.
There
have
been
greater
than
2-fold
increases
in

Administration
of
during
therapy
with
a
tricyclic

has
been
shown
to
produce
a

and
careful
adjustment
of
the
dosage
are
required
when

Drugs
Metabolized
by
P450IID6
A
subset
(
3
%
to
10
%
)
of
the
population
has
reduced
activity
of
certain
drug
metabolizing
enzymes
such
as
the
cytochrome
P450
isoenzyme
P450IID6
.
Such
individuals
are
referred
to
as
poor
metabolizers
of
such
as
,
,
and
the
tricyclic
antidepressants
.
These
individuals
may
have
higher
than
expected
plasma
concentrations
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
when
given
usual
doses
.
In
addition
,
certain
that
are
metabolized
by
this
isoenzyme
,
including
many
antidepressants
(
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
,
and
others
)
,
may
inhibit
the
activity
of
this
isoenzyme
,
and
thus
may
make
normal
metab-olizers
resemble
poor
metabolizers
with
regard
to
concomitant
therapy
with
other
metabolized
by
this
enzyme
system
,
leading
to
drug
interactions
.
Concomitant
use
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
with
other
metabolized
by
cytochrome
P450IID6
may
require
lower
doses
than
usually
prescribed
for
either
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
or
the
other
drug
.
Therefore
,
co-administration
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
with
other
that
are
metabolized
by
this
isoenzyme
,
including
other
antidepressants
,
phenothiazines
,
,
and
Type
1C
antiarrhythmics
(
eg
,
,
,
and
)
,
or
that
inhibit
this
enzyme
(
eg
,
)
,
should
be
approached
with
caution
.
Vasopressors
,
particularly
metaraminol
,
may
cause
serious
cardiac
arrhythmias
during
and
therefore
should
be
used
only
with
great
caution
or
not
at
all
.
MAO
Inhibitors
-
The
pressor
effect
of
sympathomimetic
pressor
amines
is
markedly
potentiated
in
patients
receiving
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
(
MAOI
)
.
Therefore
,
when
initiating
pressor
therapy
in
these
patients
,
the
initial
dose
should
be
small
and
used
with
due
caution
.
The
pressor
response
of
adrenergic
agents
may
also
be
potentiated
by
tricyclic
antidepressants
.
MAO
inhibitors
prolong
and
intensify
the
anticholinergic
effects
of
.
may
have
additive
effects
with
and
other
CNS
depressants
,
e.g.
,
hypnotics
,
sedatives
,
tranquilizers
,
antianxiety
agents
.
Chlorprothixene
may
increase
the
plasma-level
of
concomitantly
given
.
In
order
to
avoid
intoxication
,
plasma
levels
should
be
monitored
closely
.
If
chlorprothixene
is
given
concomitantly
with
opioids
,
the
opioid
dose
should
be
reduced
(
by
approx
.
50
%
)
,
because
chlorprothixene
amplifies
the
therapeutic
actions
and
side-effects
of
opioids
massively
.
Avoid
the
concomitant
use
of
chlorprothixene
and
(
Ultram
)
.
Massive
seizures
may
be
encountered
with
this
combination
.
Consider
additive
sedative
effects
and
confusional
states
to
emerge
,
if
chlorprothixene
is
given
with
benzodiazepines
or
barbituates
.
Choose
particular
low
doses
of
these
.
Exert
particular
caution
in
combining
chlorprothixene
with
other
anticholinergic
(
tricyclic
antidepressants
and
antiparkinsonian
agents
)

Particularly
the
elderly

Dose-time
effects
of
competitive
displacement
of
radiopertechnetate
by
sodium
following
oral

intravenous
administration
]
The
effect
of
various
doses
of
sodium
in
several
dose
fractions
on
the
extent
and
the
time
scale
of
displacement
of
radiopertechnetate
,
in
dependence
on
application
mode
,
was
studied
.
An
intravenous
dose
of
50
mg

suppression
of
organs
actively
concentrating
as
effective
as
intravenous
1000
mg
ClO-4-
simultaneously
or
1000
mg
orally
30
min
before
the
injection
of
radiopertechnetate
.
An
intravenous
injection
of
given
later
also
produces
a
complete
and
immediately
beginning
depletion
of
already
accumulated
in
the
thyroid
,
within
a
period
of
195
min
after
99m-TcO-4-injection
with
a
corresponding
increase
in
blood
levels

which
becomes
complete
after
a

application
of
offers
advantages
in
clinical
use
.
Catecholamine-depleting
,
e.g.
,
,
may
have
an
additive
effect
when
given
with
beta
blocking
agents
.
Patients
treated
concurrently
with
BREVIBLOC
(
esmolol
HCl
)
and
a
catecholamine
depletor
should
therefore
be
closely
observed
for
evidence
of
hypotension
or
marked
bradycardia
,
which
may
result
in
vertigo
,
syncope
,
or
postural
hypotension
.
A
study
of
interaction
between
BREVIBLOC
and
showed
that
concomitant
administration
of
BREVIBLOC
and
does
not
alter
plasma

.
BREVIBLOC
concentrations
were
equivocally
higher
when
given

not
affect
BREVIBLOC
pharmacokinetics
.
When
intravenous
and
BREVIBLOC
were
concomitantly
administered
in
normal
subjects
,
no
effect
on
blood
levels
was
seen
,
but
BREVIBLOC
steady-state
blood
levels
were
increased
by
46
%
in
the
presence
of

No
other
pharmacokinetic
parameters
were
changed
.
The
effect
of
BREVIBLOC
on
the
duration
of
succinylcholine-induced
neuromuscular
blockade
was
studied
in
patients
undergoing
surgery
.
The
onset
of
neuromuscular
blockade
by
was
unaffected
by
BREVIBLOC
,
but
the
duration
of
neuromuscular
blockade
was
prolonged
from
5
minutes
to
8
minutes
.
Although
the
interactions
observed
in
these
studies
do
not
appear
to
be
of
major
clinical
importance
,
BREVIBLOC
should
be
titrated
with
caution
in
patients
being
treated
concurrently
with
,
,
or
.
While
taking
beta
blockers
,
patients
with
a
history
of
severe
anaphylactic
reaction
to
a
variety
of
allergens
may
be
more
reactive
to
repeated
challenge
,
either
accidental
,
diagnostic
,
or
therapeutic
.
Such
patients
may
be
unresponsive
to
the
usual
doses
of
used
to
treat
allergic
reaction
.
Caution
should
be
exercised
when
considering
the
use
of
BREVIBLOC
and
in
patients
with
depressed
myocardial
function
.
Fatal
cardiac
arrests
have
occurred
in
patients
receiving

Additionally
,
BREVIBLOC
should
not
be
used
to
control
supraventricular
tachycardia
in
the
presence
of
agents
which
are
vasoconstrictive
and
inotropic
such
as
,
,
and
because
of
the
danger
of
blocking
cardiac
contractility
when
systemic
vascular
resistance
is
high
.
Drug
interaction
studies
with
Xigris
have
not
been
performed
in
patients
with
severe
sepsis
.
However
,
since
there
is
an
increased
risk
of
bleeding
with
Xigris
,
caution
should
be
employed
when
Xigris
is
used
with
other
that
affect
hemostasis
.
Approximately
2/3
of
the
patients
in
the
Phase
3
study
received
either
prophylactic
low
dose
(
unfractionated
up
to
15,000
units/day
)
or
prophylactic
doses
of
low
molecular
weight
heparins
as
indicated
in
the
prescribing
information
for
the
specific

Concomitant
use
of
prophylactic

did
not
appear
to
affect
safety

its
effects
on
the
efficacy
of
Xigris
have
not
been
evaluated
in
an
adequate
and
well-controlled

Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interaction
Because
Xigris
may
affect
the
APTT
assay
,
Xigris
present
in
plasma
samples
may
interfere
with
one-stage
coagulation
assays
based
on
the
APTT
(
such
as
factor
VIII
,
IX
,
and
XI
assays
)
.
This
interference
may
result
in
an
apparent
factor
concentration
that
is
lower
than
the
true
concentration
.
Xigris
present
in
plasma
samples
does
not
interfere
with
one-stage
factor
assays
based
on
the
PT
(
such
as
factor
II
,
V
,
VII
,
and
X
assays
)
.
Due
to
the
potential
for
additive
effects
,
caution
and
careful
titration
are
warranted
in
patients
receiving
hydrochloride
concomitantly
with
other
agents
known
to

that
there
may
be
additive
effects
in
prolonging
AV
conduction
when
using
beta-blockers

concomitantly
with
Tiazac
.
As
with
all
,
care
should
be
exercised
when
treating
patients
with
multiple
medications
.
Diltiazem
is
both
a
substrate
and
an
inhibitor
of
the
cytochrome
P-450
3A4
enzyme
system
.
Other
that
are
specific
substrates
,
inhibitors
,
or
inducers
of
the
enzyme
system
may
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
efficacy
and
side
effect
profile
of

Patients
taking
other
that
are
substrates
of
CYP450
3A4
,
especially
patients
with
renal
and/or
hepatic
impairment
,
may
require
dosage
adjustment
when
starting
or
stopping
concomitantly
administered
in
order
to
maintain
optimum
therapeutic
blood
levels
.
Beta
Blockers
Controlled
and
uncontrolled
domestic
studies
suggest
that
concomitant
use
of
hydrochloride
and
beta-blockers
is
usually
well
tolerated
,
but
available
data
are
not
sufficient
to
predict
the
effects
of
concomitant
treatment
in
patients
with
left
ventricular
dysfunction
or
cardiac
conduction
abnormalities
.
Administration
of
hydrochloride
concomitantly
with

five
normal
volunteers
resulted
in
increased
levels
in
all

50
%

The
effect
may
be
mediated
by
's
known
inhibition
of

,
the
enzyme
system
responsible
for
the

Patients
currently
receiving

An
adjustment
in
the
dose

be
warranted

Digitalis
Administration
of
hydrochloride
with
in
24
healthy
male
subjects
increased
plasma
concentrations
approximately
20
%
.
Another
investigator
found
no
increase
in
levels
in
12
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
.
Since
there
have
been
conflicting
results
regarding
the
effect
of
levels
,
it
is
recommended
that
levels
be
monitored
when
initiating
,
adjusting
,
and
discontinuing
hydrochloride
therapy
to
avoid
possible
over-
or
under-digitalization
.
Anesthetics
The
depression
of
cardiac
contractility
,
conductivity
,
and
automaticity
as
well
as
the
vascular
dilation
associated
with
anesthetics
may
be
potentiated
by
channel
blockers
.
When
used
concomitantly
,
anesthetics
and
channel
blockers
should
be
titrated
carefully
.
A
pharmacokinetic
interaction
between
and
has
been
observed
during
studies
involving
renal

.
In
renal
and
cardiac
transplant
recipients
,
a
reduction
of
dose
ranging
from
15
%
to
48
%
was
necessary
to
maintain
trough
concentrations
similar
to
those
seen
prior
to
the
addition
of

If
these
agents
are
to
be
administered
concurrently
,
concentrations
should
be
monitored
,
especially
when
therapy
is
initiated
,
adjusted
,
or
discontinued
.
The
effect
of

plasma
concentrations
has
not
been
evaluated
.
Concomitant
administration
of

been
reported
to
result
in
elevated
serum
levels
of
(
40
%
to
72
%
increase
)
,
resulting
in
toxicity
in
some
cases
.
Patients
receiving
these
concurrently
should
be
monitored
for
a
potential
drug
interaction
.

The
specific
objectives
of
this
study
were
to
elucidate

miracidia
.
The
toxicity
of
cadmium
,
,
and
cadmium/zinc
mixtures
at
concentrations
ranging
from
10000
to
10
microg/l
was
investigated
.
Metal
mixture
toxicity
investigation
was
undertaken
with
equal
concentrations
of
the
metals
.
The
hatching
of
miracidia
from
eggs
was
inhibited
by
concentrations
of
1000-10000
microg/l
of
single
metals
.
Metal
mixtures
had
no
effect
on
egg
hatching
.
Survival
of
miracidia
was
reduced
by
increasing
metal
concentration
except
at
concentrations
of
10
microg/l
for
single
metal
toxicity
where
survival
was
increased
above
the
control

Miracidia
demonstrated
a
rapid
avoidance
behaviour
when
briefly
exposed
to
heavy
metals

The
mechanisms
of
metal

Ephedrine
enhances
the
antinociceptive
effect
of

Dexmedetomidine
,
a
highly
selective
alpha-2-adrenoceptor
agonist
,
was
recently
introduced
into
clinical
practice
for
its
sedative
and
analgesic
properties
.
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
whether
the
psychostimulant
drug
has
any
effect
on
dexmedetomidine-induced
antinociception
and
locomotor
inhibitor
activity
in
mice
in
acute

In
both
sexes
of
swiss

antinociception
was
assessed
with
hot-plate

in
mice
,
co-administration
of
15

We
concluded
that
the

have
beneficial
effects

an
in

study
demonstrated
that
did
not
inhibit
CYP

did
produce
30
%
inhibition
of

Based
on
the

in
the
need
for
an
unusually
high
maintenance
dose
of

20
mg

in
order
to
produce
a
therapeutic
effect

the
requirement
by
50
%

This
effect
may
be
mediated
by
the
ability
of

induce
microsomal
enzymes
and
,
thus
,
the
catabolism
of

initial
dose
should
be
necessary

surgical
procedures
during

less
frequent
maintenance
dosing
,
lower
maintenance
doses
,
or
reduced
infusion
rates
of
NIMBEX

In

have
shown
that
ginsenosides
inhibit
high
threshold
voltage-dependent
Ca
(
2+

channels
in
neuronal
cells
.
However
,
these

did
not
show
whether
ginsenosides-induced

discriminates
among
the

although
it
is
known
that
there
are
at
least
five
different
Ca
(

channel
subtypes
in

In
this

we
investigated
the
effect
of

channel
subtypes
using

)
in
bovine
chromaffin

.
We
could
observe
that
ginsenosides
inhibited
high
threshold
voltage-dependent
Ca
(
2+
)
currents
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.
The
IC
(
50
)
was
about
120
microgram/ml
.
Nimodipine
had
no
effect
on
ginsenosides
response
.
These
data
suggest
that
ginsenosides
are
negatively
coupled
to
three
types
of
channels
in
bovine
chromaffin
cell
,
including
an
omega-conotoxin
GVIA-sensitive

channel
and
nimodipine/omega-conotoxin
GVIA/omega-agatoxin

Thus
,
the
selective
regulation
of
voltage-dependent
Ca

subtypes
by
ginsenosides
in

could
be

Prescribing
.
Keys
to
maximizing
benefit
while
avoiding
adverse
drug
effects
.
When
prescribing
for
older
patients
,
some
physicians
are
overly
cautious
,
and
this
strategy
can
result
in
a
less
than
optimal
treatment
outcome
.
The
reluctance
to
treat
aggressively
is
understandable
because
the
geriatric
population
is
susceptible
to
adverse
drug
reactions
.
The
key
to
maximizing
therapy
lies
in
individualizing
it
as
much
as
possible
.
There
are
a
number
of
steps
physicians
can
take
to
ensure
that
their
patients
are
not
being
undertreated
.
These
steps
include
regular
reevaluations
of
dosages
and
plasma
drug
concentrations
,
recognition
and
understanding
of
drug
side
effects
,
and
avoidance
of
certain
agents
.
Close
monitoring
allows
physicians
to
minimize
risks
,
maximize
benefits
,
and
get
the
most
out
of
what
modern
medications
can
do
to
help
older
patients
.

Selective

The
growth
of
Pseudomonas

,
particularly
serotype
O11
,
in
pentazocine
and
tripelennamine
was
evaluated
as
a
possible
explanation
for
the
association
of
deep-seated
infection
with
this
organism
and
abuse
of
these
.
The
mean
reduction
of
growth
caused
by
the

1,000-fold
greater
for

A
common
phenotypic
subset
of

was
especially
resistant
to

drug
combination
.
Dose-response
curves
(
derived
from
the
results
of
using
the
tablets
as
well
as
pure
powders
)
showed
that
tripelennamine
was
responsible
for
the
inhibitory
activity
,
which
was
partially
antagonized
by

We
conclude
that

Drugs
Metabolized
by
P450
2D6
-
The
biochemical
activity
of
the
drug
metabolizing
isozyme
cytochrome
P450
2D6
(
hydroxylase
)
is
reduced
in
a
subset
of
the
caucasian
population
(
about
7-10
%
of
caucasians
are
so
called
poor
metabolizers
)
;
reliable
estimates
of
the
prevalence
of
reduced
P450
2D6
isozyme
activity
among
Asian
,
African
and
other
populations
are
not
yet
available
.
Poor
metabolizers
have
higher
than
expected
plasma
concentrations
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
(
TCAs
)
when
given
usual
doses
.
Depending
on
the
fraction
of
drug
metabolized
by
P450
2D6
,
the
increase
in
plasma
concentration
may
be
small
,
or
quite
large
(
8-fold
increase
in
plasma
AUC
of
the
TCA
)
.
In
addition
,
certain
inhibit
the
activity
of
this
isozyme
and
make
normal
metabolizers
resemble
poor
metabolizers
.
An
individual
who
is
stable
on
a
given
dose
of
TCA
may
become
abruptly
toxic
when
given
one
of
these
inhibiting
as
concomitant
therapy
.
The
that
inhibit
cytochrome
P450
2D6
include
some
that
are
not
metabolized
by
the
enzyme
(
;
)
and
many
that
are
substrates
for
P450
2D6
(
many
other
antidepressants
,
phenothiazines
,
and
the
Type
1C
antiarrhythmics
and
)
.
While
all
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
e.g.
,
,
,
and
,
inhibit
P450
2D6
,
they
may
vary
in
the
extent
of
inhibition
.
The
extent
to
which
SSRI-TCA
interactions
may
pose
clinical
problems
will
depend
on
the
degree
of
inhibition
and
the
pharmacokinetics
of
the
SSRI
involved
.
Nevertheless
,
caution
is
indicated
in
the
coadministration
of
TCAs
with
any
of
the
SSRIs
and
also
in
switching
from
one
class
to
the
other
.
Of
particular
importance
,
sufficient
time
must
elapse
before
initiating
TCA
treatment
in
a
patient
being
withdrawn
from
,
given
the
long
half-life
of
the
parent
and
active
metabolite
(
at
least
5
weeks
may
be
necessary
)
.
Concomitant
use
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
with
that
can
inhibit
cytochrome
P450
2D6
may
require
lower
doses
than
usually
prescribed
for
either
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
or
the
other
drug
.
Furthermore
,
whenever
one
of
these
other
is
withdrawn
from
co-therapy
,
an
increased
dose
of
tricyclic
antidepressant
may
be
required
.
It
is
desirable
to
monitor
TCA
plasma
levels
whenever
a
TCA
is
going
to
be
coadministered
with
another
drug
known
to
be
an
inhibitor
of

especially
if
higher

to
be
administered
or
if
therapy
is
prolonged
,
because
of
the
potential
nephrotoxicity
and
ototoxicity
of
aminoglycosidic
antibiotics
.
Nephrotoxicity
and
ototoxicity
were
not
noted
when
ceftazidime
was
given

Chloramphenicol
has
been
shown

antibiotics
,
including
ceftazidime
,
based
on

Due
to
the
possibility
of
antagonism
in

,
particularly
when
bactericidal
activity
is
desired
,
this
drug
combination
should
be
avoided

Other
medicines

Although
certain
medicines
should
not
be
used
together
at
all
,
in
other
cases
two
different
medicines
may
be
used
together
even
if
an

might
occur
.
In
these
cases
,
your

may
want
to
change
the
dose
,
or
other
precautions
may
be
necessary
.
When

OBJECTIVES
:
To
identify
the
pharmacological
interactions
of
clinical
relevance
(
PICR
)
in
the
medication
authorization
cards
(
MAC
)
of
the
chronically

.
DESIGN
:
Cross-sectional

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:
In
December
1998
,
the

was
gathered
for
every
MAC
with
more
than
one
drug
treatment
:
age

,
classified
(
using
the

)
into

and
clinically
relevant
.
Statistical

CONCLUSIONS
:
It
is
important
to
identify
the
medications
most
commonly
involved
in
the
PICR
so
as
to
establish
corrective
measures
to
minimise
the
risks
arising
from

:
Since

contraindicated
in
patients
with
heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
,
the
co-administration
of
Argatroban
and
is
unlikely
for
this
indication
.
However
,
if
Argatroban
is
to
be
initiated
after
cessation
of
therapy
,
allow
sufficient
time
for
heparins
effect
on
the
aPTT
to
decrease
prior
to

of
Argatroban
therapy

:
Pharmacokinetic
drug-drug

have
not
been
demonstrated
.
However
,
the

and
(
5-7.5
mg
initial
oral
dose
followed
by
2.5-6
mg/day

days
)
results
in

)
.
Thrombolytic
agents
:
The
safety
and
effectiveness
of
Argatroban
with
thrombolytic
agents
have
not
been
established
.
Co-administration
:
Concomitant
use
of
Argatroban
with
antiplatelet
agents
,
thrombolytics
,
and
other
anticoagulants
may
increase
the
risk
of
bleeding
.
Drug-drug
interactions
have
not
been
observed
between
Argatroban
and
or
.
may
increase
the
effects
of
barbiturates
,
,
and
uricosurics

It
may
also
interact
with

)
,
(

,
sulfonylurea
agents
(

No
reported
interactions

The
potential
for
clinically
significant
drug-drug
interactions
posed
by
and
hydrodolasetron
appears
to
be
low
for
commonly
used
in
chemotherapy
or
surgery
,
because
hydrodolasetron
is
eliminated
by
multiple
routes
.
Blood
levels
of
hydrodolasetron
increased
24
%
when
was
coadministered
with
(
nonselective
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P-450
)
for
7
days
,
and
decreased
28
%
with
coadministration
of
(
potent
inducer
of
cytochrome
P-450
)
for
7
days
.
Dolasetron
has
been
safely
coadministered
with
used
in
chemotherapy
and
surgery
.
As
with
other
agents
which
prolong
ECG
intervals
,
caution
should
be
exercised
in
patients
taking
which
prolong
ECG
intervals
,
particularly
QTc
.
In
patients
taking
,
,
,
ACE
inhibitors
,
,
,
,
and
various
chemotherapy
agents
,
no
effect
was
shown
on
the
clearance
of
hydrodolasetron
.
Clearance
of
hydrodolasetron
decreased
by
about
27
%
when
mesylate
was
administered
intravenously
concomitantly
with
.
Dolasetron
does
not
influence
recovery
time
in
patients
.
Dolasetron
mesylate
did
not
inhibit

Interaction
of
dacarbazine
and
imexon
,
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
in
human
A375
melanoma
cells
.
We
evaluated
mechanisms
of
interaction
between
the
alkyating
agent
dacarbazine
(
DTIC
)
and
the
pro-oxidant
,
imexon
,
in
the
human
A375
melanoma
cell
line
.
The
effect
of
DTIC
and
imexon
,
alone
and
in
combination
,
was
evaluated
for
growth
inhibition
(
MTT
)
,
radiolabeled
drug
uptake
,
cellular
thiol
content
(
HPLC
)
,
and
DNA
strand
breaks
(
Comet
assay
)
.
Pharmacokinetic
and
antitumor
effects
were
evaluated
in
mice
.
Growth
inhibition
in
vitro
was
additive
with
the
two
.
There
was
no
effect
on
drug
uptake
or
on
the
number
of
DNA
strand
breaks
.
There
was
a
>
75
%
reduction
in
cellular
glutathione
and
cysteine
with
imexon
but
not
DTIC
.
Co-administration
of
the
two
in
mice
caused
an
increase
in
the
area
under
the
curve
of
both
,
but
the
combination
was
not
effective
in
reducing
human
A375
melanoma
tumors
in
vivo
.
Imexon
and
dacarbazine
show
additive
effects
in
vitro
but
not
in
vivo
in
human
A375
melanoma
cells
.
Determinants
of
cellular
sensitivity
to
topoisomerase-targeting
antitumor
.
It
is
now
clear
that
topoisomerase
activity
level
is
an
important
determinant
of
sensitivity
to
topo
.
The
regulation
of
topoisomerases
is
no
doubt
complex
and
multifaceted
and
is
probably
accomplished
through
redundancy
at
many
control
levels
.
The
mechanism
(
s
)
of
altered
topo
I
expression
in
certain
tumor
types
is
unknown
,
but
may
be
related
to
the
central
importance
of
topoisomerases
in
proliferating
cell
functions
(
transcription
,
replication
,
etc
.
)
,
and
the
aberrant
and
chronic
activation
of
these
functions
as
a
result
of
specific
tumorigenic
alterations
.
Small
differences
in
sensitivity
to
chemotherapy
can
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
cure
rates
,
and
therefore
subtle
cell
type-specific
differences
may
be
important
determinants
of
drug
sensitivity
.
Whether
abnormal
topoisomerase
quantity
and
specific
activity
are
associated
with
resistance
or
sensitivity
to
topoisomerase-targeted
chemotherapy
in
the
clinic
is
now
being
studied
.
Determinants
downstream
of
cleavable
complex
formation
that
affect
the
sensitivity
of
tumor
versus
normal
cells
to
topo
in
particular
and
DNA-damaging
agents
in
general
are
little
known
.
The
goal
of
enhancing
selective
tumor
cell
killing
relative
to
the
normal
cells
that
are
dose
limiting
may
be
achieved
either
by
overcoming
tumor
cell
resistance
or
by
protecting
normal
cells
.
Both
of
these
strategies
will
become
more
feasible
as
specific
molecular
differences
between
tumor
and
normal
cells
are
being
rapidly
identified
and
new
combination
therapies
that
take
advantage
of
these
differences
are
being
designed
and
tested
.
Phase
I
trial
of
lenalidomide
and
CCI-779
in
patients
with
relapsed
multiple
myeloma
:
evidence
for
lenalidomide-CCI-779
interaction
via
P-glycoprotein
.
Multiple
myeloma
(
MM
)
is
an
incurable
plasma-cell
neoplasm
for
which
most
treatments
involve
a
therapeutic
agent
combined
with
.
The
preclinical
combination
of
lenalidomide
with
the
mTOR
inhibitor
CCI-779
has
displayed
synergy
in
vitro
and
represents
a
novel
combination
in
MM
.
Folic
acid
in
large
amounts
may
counteract
the
antiepileptic
effect
of
,
and
primidone
,
and
increase
the
frequency
of
seizures
in
susceptible
pediatric
patients
.
Preliminary
animal
and
human
studies
have
shown
that
small
quantities
of
systemically
administered
leucovorin
enter
the
CSF
primarily
as
5-methyltetrahydro-folate
and
,
in
humans
,
remain
1
to
3
orders
of
magnitude
lower
than
the
usual
concentrations
following
intrathecal
administration
.
However
,
high
doses
of
leucovorin
may
reduce
the
efficacy
of
intrathecally
administered
.
Leucovorin
may
enhance
the
toxicity
of
.
Patients
receiving
other
narcotic
analgesics
,

tranquilizers
,
sedative-hypnotics
,
tricyclic
antidepressants
or
other
CNS
depressants
(
including
)
concomitantly
with
DILAUDID
may
exhibit
an
additive
CNS
depression
.
When
such
combined
therapy
is
contemplated
,
the
dose
of
one
or
both
agents
should
be
reduced
.
No
pharmacokinetic

The
following
information
was
obtained
from
the
literature
.
Adenosine
:
Dipyridamole
has
been
reported
to
increase
the
plasma
levels
and
cardiovascular
effects
of
adenosine
.
Adjustment
of
adenosine
dosage
may
be
necessary
.
Cholinesterase

Dipyridamole
may
counteract

.
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
sodium
carboxymethylcellulose
(
NaCMC
)
and
carboxymethylcellulose-cysteine
(
CMC-Cys
)
conjugates
on
the
intestinal
permeation
of
sodium
fluorescein
(
NaFlu
)
and
model
peptide
,
bacitracin
and
.
Cysteine
was
covalently
linked
to
carbodiimide
activated
NaCMC
.
Iodometric
titration
of
the
polymer
conjugates
was
used
to
determine
the
extent
of
immobilised
cysteine
.
Permeation
studies
were
performed
on
guinea
pig
small
intestinal
mucosa
mounted
in
Ussing-type
chamber
.
Unmodified
NaCMC
(
1

significantly
improved
the
transport
ratio
(

control
)
of
NaFlu
to
1.3
and
1
%
(
m/v

NaCMC
conjugated
with

further
enhanced
the
permeation
.
Cysteine
conjugation
at
3.6
,
5.3
and
7.3
%
(
m/m
)
resulted
in
R-values
of
1.4
,
1.7
and
1.8
,
respectively
.
Decreasing
the
concentration
of
CMC-Cys
,
exhibiting
7.3
%
(

)
of

cysteine
(
CMC-Cys7.3
)
from
1
%
(
m/v
)
to
0.5
%
(
m/v
)
decreased
the
R-value
of
NaFlu
from
1.8
to
1.2
.
NaCMC
at
1
%
(
m/v
)
in
the
presence
of
free
cysteine
had
no
significant
effect
on
the
R-value
of
NaFlu
compared
to
NaCMC
alone
.
Formulation
of
fluorescence
labelled
bacitracin
and
in
unconjugated
NaCMC
(
1
%
m/v
)
did
not
significantly
improve
the
permeation
,
however
in
the
presence
of
1
%
(
m/v
)
CMC-Cys7.3
a
significantly
improved
permeation
was
observed
(
R=
1.3
)
.
Conjugation
at
NaCMC
with
cysteine
moieties
significantly
improves
the
intestinal
permeation
of
the
hydrophilic
molecule
NaFlu
and
the
model
peptide
bacitracin
and
in
vitro
,
therefore
this
conjugated
system
maybe
useful
for
peroral
administration
of
peptide
in
the
future
.
Mitotane

.
Pharmacokinetic
studies
indicate
that
administration
of
or
does
not
affect
the
pharmacokinetics
of

Co-administration
of
naltrexone
with
Acamprosate
produced
a
25
%
increase
in
AUC
and
a
33
%
increase
in
the
Cmax
of
acamprosate
.
No
adjustment
of
dosage
is
recommended
in
such
patients
.
The
pharmacokinetics
of
naltrexone
and
its
major
metabolite
6-beta-naltrexol
were
unaffected
following
co-administration
with

that
induce

Oxcarbazepine
can
inhibit
CYP2C19
and
induce
CYP3A4/5
with
potentially
important
effects
on
plasma
concentrations
of
other
.
In
addition
,
several
AED
s
that
are
cytochrome
P450
inducers
can
decrease
plasma
concentrations
of
oxcarbazepine
and
MHD
.
Oxcarbazepine
was
evaluated
in
human
liver
microsomes
to
determine
its
capacity
to
inhibit
the
major
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
responsible
for
the
metabolism
of
other
.
Results
demonstrate
that
oxcarbazepine
and
its
pharmacologically
active
10-monohydroxy
metabolite
(
MHD
)
have
little
or
no
capacity
to
function
as
inhibitors
for
most
of
the
human
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
evaluated
(
,
CYP2A6
,
,
,
CYP2E1
,
CYP4A9
and
CYP4A11
)
with
the
exception
of
CYP2C19
and
CYP3A4/5
.
Although
inhibition
of
CYP
3A4/5
by
OXC
and
MHD
did
occur
at
high
concentrations
,
it
is
not
likely
to
be
of
clinical
significance
.
The
inhibition
of
CYP-2C19
by
OXC
and
MHD
,
however
,
is
clinically
relevant
.
In
vitro
,
the
UDP-glucuronyl
transferase
level
was
increased
,
indicating
induction
of
this
enzyme
.
Increases
of
22
%
with
MHD
and
47
%
with
oxcarbazepine
were
observed
.
As
MHD
,
the
predominant
plasma
substrate
,
is
only
a
weak
inducer
of
UDP-glucuronyl
transferase
,
it
is
unlikely
to
have
an
effect
on
that
are
mainly
eliminated
by
conjugation
through
UDP-glucuronyl
transferase
(
e.g.
,
valproic
acid
,
lamotrigine
)
.
In
addition
,
oxcarbazepine
and
MHD
induce
a
subgroup
of
the
cytochrome
P450
3A
family
(
and
CYP3A5
)
responsible
for
the
metabolism
of
dihydropyridine
antagonists
and
oral
contraceptives
,
resulting
in
a
lower
plasma
concentration
of
these
.
As
binding
of
MHD
to
plasma
proteins
is
low
(
40
%
)
,
clinically
significant
interactions
with
other
through
competition
for
protein
binding
sites
are
unlikely
.

Therefore
,
when

,
a
decrease
in

Hormonal

has
been
shown
to
influence
the
plasma
concentrations
of
the
two
hormonal
components
,
ethinylestradiol
(
EE
)
and
(
LNG
)
.
The

Based
on
studies
evaluating
possible
interactions

no

Clinically
relevant
interactions
of
pantoprazole
with

Therefore
,
when
coadministered
with
pantoprazole
,
adjustment
of
the
dosage
of
pantoprazole
or
of
such
may
not
be
necessary

of
increased
INR

in
patients
receiving
proton

Increases
in

may
lead
to
abnormal

bleeding
have
been
reported
in
patients
taking
capecitabine
concomitantly
with
coumarin-derivative
anticoagulants
such
as
and
phenprocoumon
.
Patients
taking
coumarin-derivative
anticoagulants
concomitantly
with
capecitabine
should
be
monitored
regularly
for
alterations
in
their
coagulation
parameters
(
PT
or

)
.
Leucovorin
:
The
concentration
of
is
increased
and
its
toxicity
may
be
enhanced
by
leucovorin
.
Deaths
from
severe
enterocolitis
,
diarrhea
,
and
dehydration
have
been
reported
in
elderly
patients
receiving
weekly
leucovorin
and
fluorouracil
.
Patients
receiving
other
narcotic
analgesics
,
antipsychotics
,
antianxiety
agents
,
or
other
CNS
depressants
(
including
)
concomitantly
with
hydrocodone
and
tablets
may
exhibit
an
additive
CNS
depression
.
When
combined
therapy
is
contemplated
,
the
dose
of
one
or
both
agents
should
be
reduced
.
The
use
of
MAO
inhibitors
or
tricyclic
antidepressants
with
hydrocodone
preparations
may
increase
the
effect
of
either
the
antidepressant
or
hydrocodone

The
concurrent
use
of
anticholinergics
with
hydrocodone
may
produce

Herbal
remedies
,
nephropathies
,
and
renal
disease
.
The
use
of
herbal
remedies
is
becoming
increasingly
popular
in
the
United
States
.
Research
has
shown
that
herbal
remedy
use
may
be
associated
with
acute
renal
failure
.
In
addition
,
the
use
of
herbal
remedies
may
be
detrimental
for
the
patient
with
compromised
renal
function
.
Patients
with
renal
insufficiency
or
renal
failure
may
be
at
risk
for
further
kidney
damage
as
well
as
complications
related
to
interactions
of
herbal
remedies
with
complex
renal
therapy
regimens
.
This

will
describe
the
escalating
use
of
herbal
therapy
and
the
hazards
of
herbal
remedy
use
among

DIAMOX
modifies
metabolism
with
increased
serum
levels
of

This
may
increase
or
enhance
the
occurrence
of
osteomalacia
in
some
patients
receiving
chronic
therapy
.
Caution
is
advised
in
patients
receiving
chronic
concomitant
therapy
.
By
decreasing
the
gastrointestinal
absorption
of
primidone
,
DIAMOX
may
decrease
serum
concentrations
of
primidone
and
its
metabolites
,
with
a
consequent
possible
decrease
in
anticonvulsant
effect
.
Caution
is
advised
when
beginning
,
discontinuing
,
or
changing
the
dose
of
DIAMOX
in
patients
receiving
primidone
.
Because
of
possible
additive
effects
with
other
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitors
,
concomitant
use
is
not
advisable
.
Acetazolamide
may
increase
the
effects
of
other
folic
acid
antagonists
.
Acetazolamide
may
increase
or
decrease
blood
levels
.
Consideration
should
be
taken
in
patients
being
treated
with
antidiabetic
agents
.
Acetazolamide
decreases
urinary
excretion
of

may
enhance
the
magnitude
and
duration
of
their
effect
.
Acetazolamide
reduces
urinary
excretion
of

Acetazolamide
may
prevent
the
urinary
antiseptic
effect
of

Interactions
for
vitamin
D
analogues
(
Vitamin
D2
,
Vitamin
D3
,
,
and
)
:
:
has
been
reported
to
reduce
intestinal
absorption
of
fat
soluble
vitamins
;
as
such
it
may
impair
intestinal
absorption
of
any
of
vitamin
D
.
Phenytoin/Phenobarbital
:
The
coadministration
of
or
will
not
affect
plasma
concentrations
of
vitamin
D
,
but
may
reduce
endogenous
plasma
levels
of
calcitriol/ergocalcitriol
by
accelerating
metabolism
.
Since
blood
level
of
calcitriol/ergocalcitriol
will
be
reduced
,
higher
doses
of
Rocaltrol
may
be
necessary
if
these
are
administered
simultaneously
.
Thiazides
:
Thiazides
are
known
to
induce
hypercalcemia
by
the
reduction
of
excretion
in
urine
.
Some
reports
have
shown
that
the
concomitant
administration
of
thiazides
with
vitamin
D
causes
hypercalcemia
.
Therefore
,
precaution
should
be
taken
when
coadministration
is
necessary
.
Digitalis
:
Vitamin
D
dosage
must
be
determined
with
care
in
patients
undergoing
treatment
with
,
as
hypercalcemia
in
such
patients
may
precipitate
cardiac
arrhythmias
.
:
may
inhibit
both
synthetic
and
catabolic
enzymes
of
vitamin
D
.
Reductions
in
serum
endogenous
vitamin
D
concentrations
have
been
observed
following
the
administration
of
300
mg/day
to
1200
mg/day
for
a
week
to
healthy
men
.
However
,
in
vivo
drug
interaction
studies
of
with
vitamin
D
have
not
been
investigated
.
Corticosteroids
:
A
relationship
of
functional
antagonism
exists
between
vitamin
D
analogues
,
which
promote
absorption
,
and
corticosteroids
,
which
inhibit
absorption
.
Phosphate-Binding
Agents
:
Since
vitamin
D
also
has
an
effect
on
transport
in
the
intestine
,
kidneys
and
bones
,
the
dosage
of
phosphate-binding
agents
must
be
adjusted
in
accordance
with
the
serum
concentration
.
Vitamin
D
:
The
coadministration
of
any
of
the
vitamin
D
analogues
should
be
avoided
as
this
could
create
possible
additive
effects
and
hypercalcemia
.
Supplements
:
Uncontrolled
intake
of
additional
calcium-containing
preparations
should
be
avoided
.
:
Magnesium-containing
preparations
(
eg
,
)
may
cause
hypermagnesemia
and
should
therefore
not
be
taken
during
therapy
with
vitamin
D
by
patients
on
chronic
renal
dialysis
.
There
have
been
no
formal
drug
interaction
studies
performed
with
HERCEPTIN
in
humans
.
Administration
of
in
combination
with
HERCEPTIN
resulted
in
a
two-fold
decrease
in
HERCEPTIN
clearance
in
a
non-human
primate
study
and
in
a
1.5-fold
increase
in
HERCEPTIN
serum
levels
in
clinical
studies

Concomitant
use
of
with
,
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
barbiturates

may
have
an
additive
effect
.
When
sympathomimetic
are
given
to
patients
receiving
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
,
hypertensive
reactions
,
including
hypertensive
crises
,
may
occur
.
The
antihypertensive
effects
of
,
mecamylamine
,
,
and
veratrum
alkaloids
may
be
reduced
by
sympathomimetics
.
Beta-adrenergic
blocking
agents
may
also
interact
with
sympathomimetics
.
Increased
ectopic
pacemaker
activity
can
occur
when
is
used
concomitantly
with

Antacids
increase
the
rate
of

Pharmacokinetic
studies
show
that
there
are
no
significant
alterations
in
pharmacokinetic
parameters
of
or
to
warrant
dosage
adjustment
when
megestrol
acetate
is
administered
with
these
.
A
pharmacokinetic
study
demonstrated
that
coadministration
of
megestrol
acetate
and
results
in
a
significant
decrease
in
the
pharmacokinetic
parameters
(
~36
%
for
Cmax
and
~28
%
for
AUC
)
of
.
Administration
of
a
higher
dose
of
should
be
considered
when
coadministering
with
megestrol
acetate
.
The
effects
of
,
or
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
megestrol
acetate
were
not
studied
.
Drugs

The
potential
for
pharmacokinetic
drug-drug
interactions
between
alprostadil

other
agents
has
not
been
formally
studied
.
Bosentan
is
metabolized
by
and
.
Inhibition
of
these
isoenzymes
may
increase
the
plasma
concentration
of
bosentan
.
Bosentan
is
an
inducer
of
and
.
Consequently
,
plasma
concentrations
of
metabolized
by
these
two
isoenzymes
will
be
decreased
when
TRACLEER
is
co-administered
.
Bosentan
had
no
relevant
inhibitory
effect
on
any
CYP
isoenzymes
tested
(
,
,
CYP2C19
,
,
)
.
Consequently
,
TRACLEER
is
not
expected
to
increase
the
plasma
concentrations
of
metabolized
by
these
enzymes
.
Hormonal
Contraceptives
,
Including
Oral
,
Injectable
,
Transdermal
,
and
Implantable
Contraceptives
:
An
interaction
study
demonstrated
that
co-administration
of
bosentan
and
the
oral
hormonal
contraceptive
Ortho-Novum
produced
average
decreases
of
and
ethinyl
levels
of
14
%
and
31
%
,
respectively
.
However
,
decreases
in
exposure
were
as
much
as
56
%
and
66
%
,
respectively
,
in
individual
subjects
.
Therefore
,
hormonal
contraceptives
,
including
oral
,
injectable
,
transdermal
,
and
implantable
forms
,
may
not
be
reliable
when
TRACLEER
is
co-administered
.
Women
should
practice
additional
methods
of
contraception
and
not
rely
on
hormonal
contraception
alone
when
taking
TRACLEER
.
Specific
interaction
studies
have
demonstrated
the
following
:
A
:
During
the
first
day
of
concomitant
administration
,
trough
concentrations
of
bosentan
were
increased
by
about
30-fold
.
Steady-state
bosentan
plasma
concentrations
were
3-
to
4-fold
higher
than
in
the
absence
of
A
.
The
concomitant
administration
of
bosentan
and
A
is
contraindicated
.
Co-administration
of
bosentan
decreased
the
plasma
concentrations
of
A
(
a
substrate
)
by
approximately
50
%
.
:
Co-administration
of
and
bosentan
has
not
been
studied
in
man
.
Co-administration
of
and
bosentan
resulted
in
markedly
increased
plasma
concentrations
of
bosentan
in
animals
.
Caution
should
be
exercised
if
and
bosentan
are
used
together
.
:
An
increased
risk
of
elevated
liver
aminotransferases
was
observed
in
patients
receiving
concomitant
therapy
with
.
Therefore
,
the
concomitant
administration
of
TRACLEER
and
is
contraindicated
,
and
alternative
hypoglycemic
agents
should
be
considered
.
Co-administration
of
bosentan
decreased
the
plasma
concentrations
of
by
approximately
40
%
.
The
plasma
concentrations
of
bosentan
were
also
decreased
by
approximately
30
%
.
Bosentan
is
also
expected
to
reduce
plasma
concentrations
of
other
oral
hypoglycemic
agents
that
are
predominantly
metabolized
by
or
.
The
possibility
of
worsened
control
in
patients
using
these
agents
should
be
considered
.
:
Co-administration
of
bosentan
125
mg
b.i.d
.
and
,
a
potent
inhibitor
,
increased
the
plasma
concentrations
of
bosentan
by
approximately
2-fold
.
No
dose
adjustment
of
bosentan
is
necessary
,
but
increased
effects
of
bosentan
should
be
considered
.
and
Other
Statins
:
Co-administration
of
bosentan
decreased
the
plasma
concentrations
of
(
a
substrate
)
,
and
its
active
-hydroxy
acid
metabolite
,
by
approximately
50
%
.
The
plasma
concentrations
of
bosentan
were
not
affected
.
Bosentan
is
also
expected
to
reduce
plasma
concentrations
of
other
statins
that
have
significant
metabolism
by
,
such
as
and
.
The
possibility
of
reduced
statin
efficacy
should
be
considered
.
Patients
using
metabolized
statins
should
have
cholesterol
levels
monitored
after
TRACLEER
is
initiated
to
see
whether
the
statin
dose
needs
adjustment
.
:
Co-administration
of
bosentan
500
mg
b.i.d
.
for
6
days
decreased
the
plasma
concentrations
of
both
(
a
substrate
)
and
(
a
substrate
)
by
29
and
38
%
,
respectively
.
Clinical
experience
with
concomitant
administration
of
bosentan
and
in
patients
with
pulmonary
arterial
hypertension
did
not
show
clinically
relevant
changes
in
INR
or
dose
(
baseline
vs.
end
of
the
clinical
studies
)
,
and
the
need
to
change
the
dose
during
the
trials
due
to
changes
in
INR
or
due
to
adverse
events
was
similar
among
bosentan-
and
placebo-treated
patients
.
,
Nimodipine
and
Losartan
:
Bosentan
has
no
significant
pharmacokinetic
interactions
with
and
nimodipine
,
and
has
no
significant
effect
on
plasma
levels
of
bosentan
.
Some
anticonvulsants
may
interact
with
.
They
can
either
increase
or
decrease
the
effect
of
.
Those
anticonvulsants
include
divalproex
sodium
,
valproic
acid
,
and
.
may
also
affect
the
effects
of
other
,
which
include
some
steroid
medications
,
,
certain
heart
medicines
,
birth
control
pills
,
anti-infective
medicines
,
and
Please
note
that
may
interact
with
other
that
are
not
listed
here
.
Vasopressors
,
particularly
metaraminol
,
may
cause
serious
cardiac
arrhythmias
during
and
therefore
should
be
used
only
with
great
caution
or
not
at
all
.
MAO
Inhibitors
:
The
pressor
effect
of
sympathomimetic
pressor
amines
is
markedly
potentiated
in
patients
receiving
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
(
MAOI
)
.
Therefore
,
when
initiating
pressor
therapy
in
these
patients
,
the
initial
dose
should
be
small
and
used
with
due
caution
.
The
pressor
response
of
adrenergic
agents
may
also
be
potentiated
by
tricyclic
antidepressants
.
In
vitro
studies
with
human
liver
microsomes
showed
that
terbinafine
does
not
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
,
ethinylestradiol
,
ethoxycoumarin
,
and
.
In
vitro
studies
have
also
shown
that
terbinafine
inhibits
CYP2D6-mediated
metabolism
.
This
may
be
of
clinical
relevance
for
compounds
predominantly
metabolized
by
this
enzyme
,
such
as
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
-blockers
,
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
and
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
(
MAO-Is
)
Type
B
,
if
they
have
a
narrow
therapeutic
window
.
In
vivo
drug-drug
interaction
studies
conducted
in
normal
volunteer
subjects
showed
that
terbinafine
does
not
affect
the
clearance
of
or
.
Terbinafine
decreases
the
clearance
of
by
19
%
.
Terbinafine
increases
the
clearance
of
by
15
%
.
There
have
been
spontaneous
reports
of
increase
or
decrease
in
prothrombin
times
in
patients
concomitantly
taking
oral
terbinafine
and
,
however
,
a
causal
relationship
between
LAMISIL
Tablets
and
these
changes
has
not
been
established
.
Terbinafine
clearance
is
increased
100
%
by
,
a
CyP450
enzyme
inducer
,
and
decreased
33
%
by
,
a
CyP450
enzyme
inhibitor
.
Terbinafine

)
,
cardiotoxic
(
e.g.
,
)
or
hepatotoxic
(
e.g.
,

The
safety
and
efficacy
of
PROLEUKIN
in
combination
with
any
antineoplastic
agents
have
not
been
established
.
In
addition
,
reduced
kidney

liver
function
secondary
to
PROLEUKIN
treatment
may
delay
elimination
of
concomitant
medications
and
increase
the
risk
of
adverse

containing
sequential
high
dose
PROLEUKIN
and
antineoplastic
agents
,
specifically
,
dacarbazine
,
cis-platinum
,
and
interferon-alfa
.
These
reactions
consisted
of
erythema
,
pruritus
,
and
hypotension
and
occurred
within
hours
of
administration
of
chemotherapy
.
These
events
required
medical
intervention
in
some
patients
.
Myocardial

Delayed
Adverse
Reactions
to
Iodinated
Contrast
Media
:
A
review
of
the
literature
revealed
that
12.6
%
(
range
11-28
%
)
of
501
patients
treated
with
various
interleukin-2
containing
regimens
who
were
subsequently
administered
radiographic
iodinated
contrast
media
experienced
acute
,
atypical
adverse
reactions
.
The
onset
of
symptoms
usually
occurred
within
hours
(
most
commonly
1
to
4
hours
)
following
the
administration
of
contrast

.
These
reactions
include

,
chills
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
pruritus
,
rash
,
diarrhea
,
hypotension
,
edema
,
and
oliguria
.
Some
clinicians
have
noted
that
these
reactions
resemble
the
immediate
side
effects
caused
by
interleukin-2
administration
,
however
the
cause
of
contrast
reactions
after
interleukin-2
therapy
is
unknown
.
Most
events
were
reported
to
occur
when
contrast

was
given
within
4
weeks
after
the
last

These
events
were
also
reported
to
occur
when

was
given
several
months
after
interleukin-2
treatment

Drug
Interactions
.
TAMBOCOR
has
been
administered
to
patients
receiving
preparations
or
beta-adrenergic
blocking
agents
without
adverse
effects
.
During
administration
of
multiple
oral
doses
of
TAMBOCOR
to
healthy
subjects
stabilized
on
a
maintenance
dose
of
,
a
13
%
-19
%
increase
in
plasma
levels
occurred
at
six
hours
postdose
.
In
a
study
involving
healthy
subjects
receiving
TAMBOCOR
and
concurrently
,
plasma
levels
were
increased
about
20
%
and
levels
were
increased
about
30
%
compared
to
control
values
.
In
this
formal
interaction
study
,
TAMBOCOR
and
were
each
found
to
have
negative
inotropic
effects
;
when
the
were
administered
together
,
the
effects
were
additive
.
The
effects
of
concomitant
administration
of
TAMBOCOR
and
on
the
PR
interval
were
less
than
additive
.
In
TAMBOCOR
clinical
trials
,
patients
who
were
receiving
beta
blockers
concurrently
did
not
experience
an
increased
incidence
of
side
effects
.
Nevertheless
,
the
possibility
of
additive
negative
inotropic
effects
of
beta
blockers
and
should
be
recognized
.
Flecainide
is
not
extensively
bound
to
plasma
proteins
.
In
vitro
studies
with
several
which
may
be
administered
concomitantly
showed
that
the
extent
of
binding
to
human
plasma
proteins
is
either
unchanged
or
only
slightly
less
.
Consequently
,
interactions
with
other
which
are
highly
protein
bound
(
e.g.
,
anticoagulants
)
would
not
be
expected
.
TAMBOCOR
has
been
used
in
a
large
number
of
patients
receiving
without
apparent
interaction
.
Limited
data
in
patients
receiving
known
enzyme
inducers
(
,
,
)
indicate
only
a
30
%
increase
in
the
rate
of
elimination
.
In
healthy
subjects
receiving
(
1
gm
daily
)
for
one
week
,
plasma
levels
increased
by
about
30
%
and
half-life
increased
by
about
10
%
.
When
is
added
to
therapy
,
plasma
levels
may
increase
two-fold
or
more
in
some
patients
,
if
dosage
is
not
reduced
.
Drugs
that
inhibit
cytochrome
P450IID6
,
such
as
,
might
increase
the
plasma
concentrations
of
in
patients
that
are
on
chronic
therapy
;
especially
if
these
patients
are
extensive
metabolizers
.
There
has
been
little
experience
with
the
coadministration
of
TAMBOCOR
and
either
or
.
Because
both
of
these
have
negative
inotropic
properties
and
the
effects
of
coadministration
with
TAMBOCOR
are
unknown
,
neither
nor
should
be
administered
concurrently
with
TAMBOCOR
unless
,
in
the
judgment
of
the
physician
,
the
benefits
of
this
combination
outweigh
the
risks
.
There
has
been
too
little
experience
with
the
coadministration
of
TAMBOCOR
with
or
to
recommend
concomitant
use
.
Ritalin
may
decrease
the
hypotensive
effect
of
.
Use
cautiously
with
pressor
agents
.
Human
pharmacologic
studies
have
shown
that
Ritalin
may
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
coumarin
anticoagulants
,
anticonvulsants
(
,
diphenylhydantoin
,
primidone
)
,
,
and
tricyclic
(

)
.
Downward
dosage
adjustments
of
these
may
be
required
when
given
concomitantly
with
Ritalin
.
Serious
adverse
events
have
been
reported
in
concomitant
use
with

although
no
causality
for
the
combination
has
been
established
.
The
safety
of
using
methylphenidate
in
combination
with
or
other
centrally
acting
alpha-2
agonists
has
not
been
systemically
evaluated
.
Since
Zarontin
(
)
may
interact
with
concurrently
administered
antiepileptic
,
periodic
serum
level
determinations
of
these
may
be
necessary
(

.
RATIONALE
:
Stress
and
glucocorticoids

psychostimulant
self-administration
in
rodents
.
However
,
the
effects
of
stress
and
glucocorticoids
on
the
subjective

behavioral
effects
of
psychostimulants
have
not
been
well
studied
in

.
OBJECTIVES
:
To
examine
the
effects
of
acute

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
contrast
to
the
effects
of
glucocorticoids
in
rodent
studies
,
these
results
indicate
that
an
acute
increase
in
cortisol

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS
:
There
is
evidence
that
and
cause
renal
and
ocular
vasodilation
.
There
is
,
however
,
currently
no
data
on
the
effect
of
combined
hyperglycaemia
and
hyperinsulinaemia
on
the
renal
and

blood
flow
seen
in
diabetic
patients
on
therapy
.
METHODS
:
We
carried
out
two
different
3-way
crossover
studies
in
healthy
subjects
(
each
,
n
=
9
)
.
In
study
one
,
hyperglycaemic
clamps
(
5.6
mmol/l
,
11.1
mmol/
1
,
16.7
mmol/l
)
were
carried
out
during
placebo
or
(
dose
1
:
1
mU/kg/min
;
dose
2
:
2
mU/kg/min
)
infusion
.
The
second
study
was
identical
but
endogenous
secretion
was
blocked
with
somatostatin
.
The
renal
plasma
flow
,
glomerular
filtration
rate
and
pulsatile
choroidal
blood
flow
were
measured
using
the
paraaminohippurate
method
,
the
inulin
method
and
a
laser
interferometric
measurement
of
fundus
pulsation
amplitude
,
respectively
.
RESULTS
:
increased
renal
plasma
flow
and
fundus
pulsation
amplitude
but
not
the
glomerular
filtration
rate
.
Hyperglycaemia
increased
all
the
renal
and
ocular
parameters
studied
.
Haemodynamic
effects
of
and
were
additive
when
somatostatin
was
co-administered
but
not
under
basal
conditions
.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION
:
and
can
exert
additive
vasodilator
properties
on
renal
and
ocular
circulation
.
To

Lack
of
an
effect
of
on
the
disposition
of
and
dideoxyinosine
in
HIV-infected
patients
.
Two
studies
were
conducted
in
HIV-infected
subjects
to
assess
the
potential
for
to
interact
with
and
dideoxyinosine
.
Both
studies
used
12
subjects
.
The
study
dosed
subjects
with
1200
mg/day
of
(
n
=
7
)
(
later
changed
to
600
mg/day
[
n
=
5
]
)
for
Days
8
to
21
of
a
21-day
course
of
100
mg
,
five
times/day
of
.
Subjects
treated
with
200
mg
of
dideoxyinosine
twice
daily
for
21
days
received
1200
mg
of
or
an
equivalent
amount
of
placebo/day
for
Days
8
to
21
.
Antiretroviral
plasma
and
urine
sampling
were
conducted
on
Days
1
,
7
,
and
21
for
and
on
Days
7
and
21
for
dideoxyinosine
.
Peripheral
mononuclear
cells
were
also
collected
for
quantitation
of
phosphorylated
.
Azithromycin
had
no
significant
impact
on
the
Cmax
and
AUC
of
,
although
it
significantly
decreased
the
tmax
by
44
%
and
increased
the
intracellular
exposure
to
phosphorylated
by
110
%
.
Azithromycin
had
no
significant
effect
on
dideoxyinosine
pharmacokinetics
.
Based
on
the
results
of
these
studies
,
it
is
concluded
that
may
be
safely
coadministered
with
both
and
dideoxyinosine
.
In
normal
volunteers
receiving
,
the
administration
of
diflunisal
decreased
the
renal
clearance
and
significantly
increased
the
plasma
levels
of
.
In
some
patients
,
combined
use
of
INDOCIN
and
diflunisal
has
been
associated
with
fatal
gastrointestinal
hemorrhage
.
Therefore
,
diflunisal
and
INDOCIN
should
not
be
used
concomitantly
.
In
a
study
in
normal
volunteers
,
it
was
found
that
chronic
concurrent
administration
of
3.6
g
of
per
day
decreases
blood
levels
approximately
20
%
.
The
concomitant
use
of
INDOCIN
with
other
NSAIDs
is
not
recommended
due
to
the
increased
possibility
of
gastrointestinal
toxicity
,
with
little
or
no
increase
in
efficacy
.
Clinical
studies
have
shown
that
INDOCIN
does
not
influence
the
hypoprothrombinemia
produced
by
anticoagulants
.
However
,
when
any
additional
drug
,
including
INDOCIN
,
is
added
to
the
treatment
of
patients
on
therapy
,
the
patients
should
be
observed
for
alterations
of
the
prothrombin
time
.
In
post-marketing
experience
,
bleeding
has
been
reported
in
patients
on
concomitant
treatment
with
anticoagulants
and
INDOCIN
.
Caution
should
be
exercised
when
INDOCIN
and
anticoagulants
are
administered
concomitantly
.
When
INDOCIN
is
given
to
patients
receiving
,
the
plasma
levels
of
are
likely
to
be
increased
.
Therefore
,
a
lower
total
daily
dosage
of
INDOCIN
may
produce
a
satisfactory
therapeutic
effect
.
When
increases
in
the
dose
of
INDOCIN
are
made
,
they
should
be
made
carefully
and
in
small
increments
.
Caution
should
be
used
if
INDOCIN
is
administered
simultaneously
with
.
INDOCIN
has
been
reported
to
decrease
the
tubular
secretion
of
and
to
potentiate
its
toxicity
.
Administration
of
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
concomitantly
with
has
been
associated
with
an
increase
in
cyclosporine-induced
toxicity
,
possibly
due
to
decreased
synthesis
of
renal
prostacyclin
.
NSAIDs
should
be
used
with
caution
in
patients
taking
,
and
renal
function
should
be
carefully
monitored
.
Capsules
INDOCIN
50
mg
t.i.d
.
produced
a
clinically
relevant
elevation
of
plasma
and
reduction
in
renal
clearance
in
psychiatric
patients
and
normal
subjects
with
steady
state
plasma
concentrations
.
This
effect
has
been
attributed
to
inhibition
of
prostaglandin
synthesis
.
As
a
consequence
,
when
INDOCIN
and
are
given
concomitantly
,
the
patient
should
be
carefully
observed
for
signs
of
toxicity
.
(
Read
circulars
for
preparations
before
use
of
such
concomitant
therapy
.
)
In
addition
,
the
frequency
of
monitoring
serum
concentration
should
be
increased
at
the
outset
of
such
combination
drug
treatment
.
INDOCIN
given
concomitantly
with
has
been
reported
to
increase
the
serum
concentration
and
prolong
the
half-life
of
.
Therefore
,
when
INDOCIN
and
are
used
concomitantly
,
serum
levels
should
be
closely
monitored
.
In
some
patients
,
the
administration
of
INDOCIN
can
reduce
the
,
natriuretic
,
and
antihypertensive
effects
of
loop
,
potassium-sparing
,
and
thiazide
.
Therefore
,
when
INDOCIN
and
INDOCIN
.
(
)
are
used
concomitantly
,
the
patient
should
be
observed
closely
to
determine
if
the
desired
effect
of
the
is
obtained
.
INDOCIN
reduces
basal
plasma
renin
activity
(
PRA
)
,
as
well
as
those
elevations
of
PRA
induced
by
administration
,
or
salt
or
volume
depletion
.
These
facts
should
be
considered
when
evaluating
plasma
renin
activity
in
hypertensive
patients
.
It
has
been
reported
that
the
addition
of
to
a
maintenance
schedule
of
INDOCIN
resulted
in
reversible
acute
renal
failure
in
two
of
four
healthy
volunteers
.
INDOCIN
and
should
not
be
administered
together
.
INDOCIN
and
potassium-sparing
each
may
be
associated
with
increased
serum
levels
.
The
potential
effects
of
INDOCIN
and
potassium-sparing
on
kinetics
and
renal
function
should
be
considered
when
these
agents
are
administered
concurrently
.
Most
of
the
above
effects
concerning
have
been
attributed
,
at
least
in
part
,
to
mechanisms
involving
inhibition
of
prostaglandin
synthesis
by
INDOCIN
.
Blunting
of
the
antihypertensive
effect
of
beta-adrenoceptor
blocking
agents
by
non-steroidal
antiinflammatory
including
INDOCIN
has
been
reported
.
Therefore
,
when
using
these
blocking
agents
to
treat
hypertension
,
patients
should
be
observed
carefully
in
order
to
confirm
that
the
desired
therapeutic
effect
has
been
obtained
.
INDOCIN
can
reduce
the
antihypertensive
effects
of
and
.
False-negative
results
in
the
suppression
test
(
DST
)
in
patients
being
treated
with
INDOCIN
have
been
reported
.
Thus
,
results
of
the
DST
should
be
interpreted
with
caution
in
these
patients
.
It
is
recommended
that
buspirone
hydrochloride
not
be
used
concomitantly
with
MAO
inhibitors
Because
the
effects
of
concomitant
administration
of
buspirone
HCl
with
most
other
psychotropic
have
not
been
studied
,
the
concomitant
use
of
buspirone
HCl
with
other
CNS-active
should
be
approached
with
caution
.
There
is
one
report
suggesting
that
the
concomitant
use
of
trazodone
hydrochloride
(
Desyrel
)
and
buspirone
HCl
may
have
caused
3-
to
6-fold
elevations
on
SGPT
(
ALT
)
in
a
few
patients
.
In
a
similar
study
,
attempting
to
replicate
this
finding
,
no
interactive
effect
on
hepatic
transaminases
was
identified
.
In
a
study
in
normal
volunteers
,
concomitant
administration
of
buspirone
HCl
and
resulted
in
increased
serum
concentrations
.
The
clinical
significance
of
this
finding
is
not
clear
.
In
vitro
,
buspirone
does
not
displace
tightly
bound
like
,
,
and
from
serum
proteins
.
However
,
there
has
been
one
report
of
prolonged
prothrombin
time
when
buspirone
was
added
to
the
regimen
of
a
patient
treated
with
.
The
patient
was
also
chronically
receiving
,
,
,
and
sodium
.
In
vitro
,
buspirone
may
displace
less
firmly
bound
like
.
The
clinical
significance
of
this
property
is
unknown
.
FLUOTHANE
augments
the
action
of
non-depolarising
muscle
relaxants
and
the
muscle
relaxant
effects
of
aminoglycosides
.
FLUOTHANE
may
augment
the
hypotension
caused
by
the
ganglionic-blocking
effect
of
.
Caution
should
be
exercised
during
the
administration
of
adrenaline
to
patients
anaesthetised
with
FLUOTHANE
as
arrhythmias
may
be
precipitated
.
For
this
reason
the
dose
of
adrenaline
should
be
restricted
and
an
agent
administered
as
appropriate
.
Caution
should
also
be
applied
for
other
sympathomimetics
,
and
for
and
and
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
which
may
also
precipitate
arrhythmias
.
There
have

no
formal
drug-interaction

enzymes
may
not
be
ruled
out
.
Laboratory

Ascorbic
acid
and

.
Evaluation
of
its
efficacy
and
toxicity
.
We
reviewed
the
clinical
data
relating
to
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
pharmacologic
doses
of
ascorbic
acid
in
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
the
common
cold
.
Although
one
study
tentatively
supports
the
hypothesis
that
such
doses
of
ascorbic
acid
may
be
efficacious
,
a
second
study
by
the
same
group
did
not
confirm
the
significant
findings
,
and
no
clear
,
reproducible
pattern
of
efficacy
has
emerged
from
the
review
of
all
the
evidence
.
Similarly
,
there
is
currently
little
adequate
evidence
on
either
the
presence
or
the
absence
of
serious
adverse
reactions
to
such
doses
of
ascorbic
acid
,
although
many
such
reactions
have
been
hypothesized
.
The
unrestricted
use
of
ascorbic
acid
for
these
purposes
can
not
be
advocated
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
currently
available
.

as
well
as

.
The
3-
[
(
2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl

also
had
a
significant
effect
on
the

loss
of
neurons
in
the
locus

In
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated
animals
,
almost
40
%
loss
of
tyrosine
hydroxylase-positive
neurons
was
found
in

,
whereas
the

Our
data
demonstrate
that
chronic
treatment

the
metabotropic
glutamate
5
antagonist
,
3-

reduces
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
toxicity
towards
dopaminergic
and
noradrenergic
cell
groups
in
non-human
primates
.
This
suggests
that
the
use
of
metabotropic

may
be
a
useful
strategy
to
reduce
degeneration
of

This

investigates
the

with
the
other
three
in
the
remaining
four
cell

resulted
in
variable
interactions
.
Mechanistic
investigations
revealed
that
exerts
different
molecular
effects
in
different
cells
.
In
some
lines
,
it
abrogates
the
drug-induced
G2/M
arrest
enhancing
pre-mature
entry
into
mitosis
with
damaged
DNA
thus
increasing
apoptosis
and
resulting
in
synergism
.
In
other
cells
,
it
enhances
drug-induced
G2/M
arrest
allowing
time
to
repair
drug-induced
DNA
damage
before
entry
into
mitosis
and
decreasing
cell
death
resulting
in
antagonism
.
In
some
synergistic
combinations
,
celecoxib-induced
abrogation
of
G2/M
arrest
was
not
associated
with
apoptosis
but
permanent
arrest
in
G1
phase
.
These
results
,
if
confirmed
in-vivo
,
indicate
that
is
not
a
suitable
chemosensitizer
for
breast
cancer
or
with
for

Moreover
,

other
should
be
tailored
to
the
tumor
type

administration
schedule

Therefore
,
when
EDECRIN

18-Methoxycoronaridine
(
18-MC
)
and
ibogaine
:
comparison
of
antiaddictive
efficacy
,
toxicity
,
and
mechanisms
of
action

18-MC
,
a
novel
iboga
alkaloid
congener
,
is
being
developed
as
a
potential
treatment
for
multiple
forms
of
drug
abuse
.
Like
ibogaine
(
40
mg/kg
)
,
18-MC
(
40
mg/kg
)
decreases
the
intravenous
self-administration
of
and
cocaine
and
the
oral
self-administration
of
and
in
rats
;
unlike
ibogaine
,
18-MC
does
not
affect
responding
for
a
nondrug
reinforcer
(
water
)
.
Both
ibogaine
and
18-MC
ameliorate
opioid
withdrawal
signs
.
Both
ibogaine
and
18-MC
decrease
extracellular
levels
of
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
,
but
only
ibogaine
increases
extracellular
levels
of
serotonin
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
.
Both
ibogaine
and
18-MC
block
morphine-induced
and
nicotine-induced
release
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
;
only
ibogaine
enhances
cocaine-induced
increases
in
accumbal
.
Both
ibogaine
and
18-MC
enhance
the
locomotor
and/or
stereotypic
effects
of
stimulants
.
Ibogaine
attenuates
,
but
18-MC
potentiates
,
the
acute
locomotor
effects
of
;
both
compounds
attenuate
morphine-induced
locomotion
in
morphine-experienced
rats
.
Ibogaine
produces
whole
body
tremors
and
,
at
high
doses
(
>
or
=
100
mg/kg
)
,
cerebellar
damage
;
18-MC
does
not
produce
these
effects
.
Ibogaine
,
but
not
18-MC
,
decreases
heart
rate
at
high
doses
.
While
18-MC
and
ibogaine
have
similar
affinities
for
kappa
opioid
and
possibly
nicotinic
receptors
,
18-MC
has
much
lower
affinities
than
ibogaine
for
NMDA
and
sigma-2
receptors
,
sodium
channels
,
and
the
5-HT
transporter
.
Both
18-MC
and
ibogaine
are
sequestered
in
fat
and
,
like
ibogaine
,
18-MC
probably
has
an
active
metabolite
.
The
data
suggest
that
18-MC
has
a
narrower
spectrum
of
actions
and
will
have
a
substantially
greater
therapeutic
index
than
ibogaine
.
Effect

Nateglinide
is
highly
bound
to
plasma
proteins
(
98
%
)
,
mainly
albumin
.
In

studies
with
highly
protein-bound
such
as

,
,
acetylsalicylic
acid
,
,
and
showed
no
influence
on
the
extent
of
nateglinide

Similarly
,
nateglinide
had
no
influence
on
the
serum
protein
binding
of
,
,
,
,
,
acetylsalicylic
acid
,
and
in

.
However
,
prudent
evaluation
of
individual
cases
is
warranted
in
the
clinical
setting
.
Certain
,
including
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
agents
(
NSAIDs
)
,
salicylates
,
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
,
and
non-selective
beta-adrenergic-blocking
agents
may
potentiate
the
hypoglycemic
action
of
Starlix
and
other
oral
antidiabetic
.
Certain
including
thiazides
,
corticosteroids
,
thyroid
products
,
and
sympathomimetics
may
reduce
the
hypoglycemic
action
of
Starlix
and
other
oral
antidiabetic
.
When
these
are
administered
to
or
withdrawn
from
patients
receiving
Starlix
,
the
patient
should
be
observed
closely
for
changes
in

,
such
as
the
neuroleptics
(

ordinarily
should
not
be

may
diminish
the
effectiveness
of

.
Because
pergolide
mesylate
is
approximately
90

,
caution
should
be
exercised
if

Iron
Supplements
and
Foods
Fortified
With
Iron
Concomitant
administration
of
cefdinir
with
a
therapeutic
supplement
containing
60
mg
of
elemental
(
as
FeSO4
)
or
vitamins
supplemented
with
10
mg
of
elemental
reduced
extent
of
absorption
by
80
%
and
31
%
,
respectively
.
If
supplements
are
required
during
OMNICEF
therapy
,
OMNICEF
should
be
taken
at
least
2
hours
before
or
after
the
supplement
.
The
effect
of
foods
highly
fortified
with
elemental
(
primarily
iron-fortified
breakfast
cereals
)
on
cefdinir
absorption
has
not
been
studied
.
Concomitantly
administered
iron-fortified
infant
formula
(
2.2
mg
elemental
iron/6
oz
)
has
no
significant
effect
on
cefdinir
pharmacokinetics
.
Therefore
,
OMNICEF
for
Oral
Suspension
can
be
administered
with
iron-fortified
infant
formula
.
There
have
been
rare
reports
of
reddish
stools
in
patients
who
have
received
cefdinir
in
Japan
.
The
reddish
color
is
due
to
the
formation
of
a
nonabsorbable
complex
between
cefdinir
or
its
breakdown
products
and
in
the
gastrointestinal
tract
.
Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions
A
false-positive
reaction
for
ketones
in
the
urine
may
occur
with
tests
using
,
but
not
with
those
using
.
The
administration
of
cefdinir
may
result
in
a
false-positive
reaction
for
in
urine
using
Clinitest
,
Benedict
s
solution
,
or
Fehlings
solution
.
It
is
recommended
that
tests
based
on
enzymatic
oxidase
reactions
(
such
as
Clinistix
or
Tes-Tape
)
be
used
.
Cephalosporins
are
known
to
occasionally
induce
a
positive
direct
Coombs
test
.
Mequitazine
can
interact
with
CNS
depressant
,
antichlolinergic
,
TCA
,
MAOIs
,
and
.
No
drug
,
nutritional
supplement
,
food
or
herb
interactions
have
yet
been
reported
.
Interaction
with
central
nervous
system
depressants
other
than
benzodiazepines
has
not
been
specifically
studied
;
however
,
no
deleterious
interactions
were
seen
when
ROMAZICON
was
administered
after
narcotics
,
inhalational
anesthetics
,
muscle
relaxants
and
muscle
relaxant
antagonists
administered
in
conjunction
with
sedation
or
.
Particular
caution
is
necessary
when
using
ROMAZICON
in
cases
of
mixed
drug
overdosage
since
the
toxic
effects
(
such
as
convulsions
and
cardiac
dysrhythmias
)
of
other
taken
in
overdose
(
especially
cyclic
antidepressants
)
may
emerge
with
the
reversal
of
the
benzodiazepine
effect
by
flumazenil
.
The
use
of
ROMAZICON
is
not
recommended
in
epileptic
patients
who
have
been
receiving
benzodiazepine
treatment
for
a
prolonged
period
.
Although
ROMAZICON
exerts
a
slight
intrinsic
anticonvulsant
effect
,
its
abrupt
suppression
of
the
protective
effect
of
a
benzodiazepine
agonist
can
give
rise
to
convulsions
in
epileptic
patients
.
ROMAZICON
blocks
the
central
effects
of
benzodiazepines
by
competitive
interaction
at
the
level
.
The
effects
of
nonbenzodiazepine
agonists
at
benzodiazepine
receptors
,
such
as
zopiclone
,
triazolopyridazines
and
others
,
are
also
blocked
by
ROMAZICON
.
The
pharmacokinetics
of
benzodiazepines
are
unaltered
in
the
presence
of
flumazenil
and
vice
versa
.
There
is
no
pharmacokinetic
interaction
between
and
flumazenil
.
Use
in
Ambulatory
Patients
The
effects
of
ROMAZICON
may
wear
off
before
a
long-acting
benzodiazepine
is
completely
cleared
from
the
body
.
In
general
,
if
a
patient
shows
no
signs
of
sedation
within
2
hours
after
a
1-mg
dose
of
flumazenil
,
serious
resedation
at
a
later
time
is
unlikely
.
An
adequate
period
of
observation
must
be
provided
for
any
patient
in
whom
either
long-acting
benzodiazepines
(
such
as
)
or
large
doses
of
short-acting
benzodiazepines
(
such
as
10
mg
of
)
have
been
used
.
Because
of
the
increased
risk
of
adverse
reactions
in
patients
who
have
been
taking
benzodiazepines
on
a
regular
basis
,
it
is
particularly
important
that
physicians
query
patients
or
their
guardians
carefully
about
benzodiazepine
,
and
sedative
use
as
part
of
the
history
prior
to
any
procedure
in
which
the
use
of
ROMAZICON
is
planned
.
Drug-Drug
Interactions
Effect
of
Exelon
(
rivastigmine
tartrate
)
on
the
Metabolism
of
Other
Drugs
:
Rivastigmine
is
primarily
metabolized
through
hydrolysis
by
esterases
.
Minimal
metabolism
occurs
via
the
major
cytochrome
P450
isoenzymes
.
Based
on
in
vitro
studies
,
no
pharmacokinetic
drug
interactions
with
metabolized
by
the
following
isoenzyme
systems
are
expected
:
,
,
CYP3A4/5
,
CYP2E1
,
,
CYP2C8
,
or
CYP2C19
.
No
pharmacokinetic
interaction
was
observed
between
rivastigmine
and
,
,
,
or
in
studies
in
healthy
volunteers
.
The
elevation
of
prothrombin
time
induced
by
is
not
affected
by
administration
of
Exelon
.
Effect
of
Other
Drugs
on
the
Metabolism
of
Exelon
:
Drugs
that
induce
or
inhibit
CYP450
metabolism
are
not
expected
to
alter
the
metabolism
of
rivastigmine
.
Single
dose
pharmacokinetic
studies
demonstrated
that
the
metabolism
of
rivastigmine
is
not
significantly
affected
by
concurrent
administration
of
,
,
,
or
.
Population
PK
analysis
with
a
database
of
625
patients
showed
that
the
pharmacokinetics
of
rivastigmine
were
not
influenced
by
commonly
prescribed
medications
such
as
(
n=77
)
,
(
n=72
)
,
channel
blockers
(
n=75
)
,
antidiabetics
(
n=21
)
,
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
(
n=79
)
,
estrogens
(
n=70
)
,
analgesics
(
n=177
)
,
antianginals
(
n=35
)
,
and
(
n=15
)
.
Use
with
Anticholinergics
:
Because
of
their
mechanism
of
action
,
cholinesterase
inhibitors
have
the
potential
to
interfere
with
the
activity
of
anticholinergic
medications
.
Use
with
Cholinomimetics
and
Other
Cholinesterase
Inhibitors
:
A
synergistic
effect
may
be
expected
when
cholinesterase
inhibitors
are
given
concurrently
with
,
similar
neuromuscular
blocking
agents
or
cholinergic
agonists
such
as
bethanechol
.
A
number
of
substances
affect
metabolism
and
may
require
dose
adjustment
and
particularly
close
monitoring
.
The
following
are
examples
of
substances
that
may
increase
the
blood-glucose-lowering
effect
and
susceptibility
to
hypoglycemia
:
oral
antidiabetic
products
,
ACE
inhibitors
,
,
fibrates
,
,
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
inhibitors
,
,
salicylates
,
somatostatin
analog
(
e.g.
,
)
,
sulfonamide
antibiotics
.
The
following
are
examples
of
substances
that
may
reduce
the
blood-glucose-lowering
effect
:
corticosteroids
,
,
,
,
sympathomimetic
agents
(
e.g.
,
,
,
)
,
,
phenothiazine
derivatives
,
,
thyroid
hormones
,
estrogens
,
progestogens
(
e.g.
,
in
oral
contraceptives
)
.
Beta-blockers
,
,
salts
,
and
may
either
potentiate
or
weaken
the
blood-glucose-lowering
effect
of
.
may
cause
hypoglycemia
,
which
may
sometimes
be
followed
by
hyperglycemia
.
In
addition
,
under
the
influence
of
sympatholytic
medicinal
products
such
as
beta-blockers
,
,
,
and
,
the
signs
of
hypoglycemia
may
be
reduced
or
absent
.
Mixing
of
Insulins
A
clinical
study
in
healthy
male
volunteers
(
n=24
)
demonstrated
that
mixing
NovoLog
with
NPH
human
immediately
before
injection
produced
some
attenuation
in
the
peak
concentration
of
NovoLog
,
but
that
the
time
to
peak
and
the
total
bioavailability
of
NovoLog
were
not
significantly
affected
.
If
NovoLog
is
mixed
with
NPH
human
,
NovoLog
should
be
drawn
into
the
syringe
first
.
The
injection
should
be
made
immediately
after
mixing
.
Because
there
are
no
data
on
the
compatibility
of
NovoLog
and
crystalline
preparations
,
NovoLog
should
not
be
mixed
with
these
preparations
.
The
effects
of
mixing
NovoLog
with
insulins
of
animal
source
or
preparations
produced
by
other
manufacturers
have
not
been
studied
.
Mixtures
should
not
be
administered
intravenously
.
When
used
in
external
subcutaneous
infusion
pumps
for
,
NovoLog
should
not
be
mixed
with
any
other
insulins
or
diluent
.
Tablets
:
The
benzodiazepines
,
including
,
produce
CNS-depressant
effects
when
administered
with
such
medications
as
barbiturates
or
.
Injection
:
Lorazepam
injection
,
like
other
injectable
benzodiazepines
,
produces
depression
of
the
central
nervous
system
when
administered
with
ethyl
,
phenothiazines
,
barbiturates
,
MAO
inhibitors
,
and
other
antidepressants.When
scopolamine
is
used
concomitantly
with
injectable
,
an
increased
incidence
of
sedation
,
hallucinations
,
and
irrational
behavior
has
been
observed
.
Certain
tend
to
produce
hyperglycemia
and
may
lead
to
loss
of

.
These
include
the
thiazides
and

corticosteroids
,
phenothiazines
,
thyroid
products
,
estrogens
,
oral
contraceptives
,
,
nicotinic
acid
,
sympathomimetics
,
channel-blocking
,
and
.
When
such
are
administered
to
a
patient
receiving
Acarbose
,
the
patient
should
be
closely
observed
for
loss
of
blood
control
.
When
such
are
withdrawn
from
patients
receiving
Acarbose
in
combination
with
sulfonylureas
or
,
patients
should
be
observed
closely
for
any
evidence
of
hypoglycemia
.
Intestinal
adsorbents
(
e.
g.
,
charcoal
)
and
digestive
enzyme
preparations
containing
carbohydrate-splitting
enzymes
(
e.
g.
,
amylase
,
pancreatin
)
may
reduce
the
effect
of
Acarbose
and
should
not
be
taken
concomitantly
.
Acarbose
has
been
shown
to
change
the
bioavailabillty
when
they
are
co-administered
,
which
may
require
dose
adjustment
.
Studies
in
healthy
volunteers
have
shown
that
Acarbose
has
no
effect
on
either
the
pharmacokinetics
or
pharmacodynamics
of
,
,
,
or
.
Acarbose
did
not
interfere
with
the
absorption
or
disposition
of
the
sulfonylurea
in
diabetic
patients
.
Acarbose
may
affect
bioavailabillty
and
may
require
dose
adjustment
of
by
16
%
(
90
%
confidence
interval
:
8-23

)
.
The
amount
of

while
taking
Acarbose
was
bioequivalent
to
the
amount
absorbed
when
taking
placebo
,
as
indicated
by
the
plasma
AUC
values
.
However
,
the
peak
plasma
level
of

reduced
by
approximately
20
%
when

Acarbose
due
to
a
slight

There
is
little
if
any
clinically
significant
interaction
between
Acarbose
and

Concomitant
use
of
supplements
and
L-lysine
may
increase
absorption
Concurrent
administration
of
HEXALEN
and
antidepressants
of
the
MAO
inhibitor
class
may
cause
severe
orthostatic
hypotension.Cimetidine
,
an
inhibitor
of
microsomal
drug
metabolism
,
increased
altretamine

in
a
rat
model
.
Data
from
a
randomized
trial
of
HEXALEN
and
plus
or
minus
pyridoxine
in
ovarian
cancer
indicated
that
pyridoxine
significantly
reduced
neurotoxicity
;
however
,
it
adversely
affected
response
duration
suggesting
that
pyridoxine
should
not
be
administered
with
HEXALEN
and/or
cisplatin.1
Diuretics
:
and
probably
other
loop
given
concomitantly
with
metolazone
can
cause
unusually
large
or
prolonged
losses
of
fluid
and
electrolytes
.
Other
:
When
MYKROX
Tablets
are
used
with
other
antihypertensive
,
care
must
be
taken
,
especially
during
initial
therapy
.
Dosage
adjustments
of
other
may
be
necessary
.
,
Barbiturates
,
and
Narcotics
:
The
hypotensive
effects
of
these
may
be
potentiated
by
the
volume
contraction
that
may
be
associated
with
metolazone
therapy
.
Digitalis
Glycosides
:
Diuretic-induced
hypokalemia
can
increase
the
sensitivity
of
the
myocardium
to

Serious
arrhythmias
can
result
.
Corticosteroids
or
:
May
increase
the
risk
of
hypokalemia
and
increase
salt
and
water
retention
.
:
Serum
levels
may
increase
.
Curariform
Drugs
:
Diuretic-induced
hypokalemia
may
enhance
neuromuscular
blocking
effects
of
curariform
(
such
as
)
the
most
serious
effect
would
be
respiratory
depression
which
could
proceed
to
apnea
.
Accordingly
,
it
may
be
advisable
to
discontinue
MYKROX
Tablets
three
days
before
elective
surgery
.
Salicylates
and
Other
Non-Steroidal
Anti-Inflammatory
Drugs
:
May
decrease
the
antihypertensive
effects
of
MYKROX
Tablets
.
Sympathomimetics
:
Metolazone
may
decrease
arterial
responsiveness
to
,
but
this
diminution
is
not
sufficient
to
preclude
effectiveness
of
the
pressor
agent
for
therapeutic
use
.
:
Efficacy
may
be
decreased
due
to
urinary
alkalizing
effect
of
metolazone
.
:
Metolazone
,
as
well
as
other
thiazide-like
,
may
affect
the
hypoprothrombinemic
response
to
anticoagulants
;
dosage
adjustments
may
be
necessary
.
The
interaction
of
Activase
with
other
cardioactive
or
cerebroactive
has
not
been
studied
.
In
addition
to
bleeding
associated
with
and
vitamin
K
antagonists
,
that
alter
platelet
function
(
such
as
acetylsalicylic
acid
,
and
Abciximab
)
may
increase
the
risk
of
bleeding
if
administered
prior
to
,
during
,
or
after
Activase
therapy
.
Use
of
Antithrombotics
and
have
been
administered
concomitantly
with
and
following
infusions
of
Activase
in
the
management
of
acute
myocardial
infarction
or
pulmonary
embolism
.
Because
,
,
or
Activase
may
cause
bleeding
complications
,
careful
monitoring
for
bleeding
is
advised
,
especially
at
arterial
puncture
sites
.
The
concomitant
use
of
or
during
the
first
24
hours
following
symptom
onset
were
prohibited
in
The
NINDS
t-PA
Stroke
Trial
.
The
safety
of
such
concomitant
use
with
Activase
for
the
management
of
acute
ischemic
stroke
is
unknown
.
Because
the
tetracyclines
have
been
shown
to
depress
plasma
prothrombin
activity
,
patients
who
are
on
therapy
may
require
downward
adjustment
of
their
dosage
.
Since
bacteriostatic
,
such
as
the
class
of
antibiotics
,
may
interfere
with
the
bactericidal
action
of
penicillins
,
it
is
not
advisable
to
administer
these
concomitantly
.
Concurrent
use
of
tetracyclines
with
oral
contraceptives
may
render
oral
contraceptives
less
effective
.
Breakthrough
bleeding
has
been
reported
:
As
with
other
NSAIDs
,
concomitant
administration
of
Ponstel
and
is
not
generally
recommended
because
of
the
potential
of
increased
adverse
effects
.
:
NSAIDs
have
been
reported
to
competitively
inhibit
accumulation
in
rabbit
kidney
slices
.
This
may
indicate
that
they
could
enhance
the
toxicity
of
.
Caution
should
be
used
when
NSAIDs
are
administered
concomitantly
with
.
ACE
inhibitors
:
Reports
suggest
that
NSAIDs
may
diminish
the
antihypertensive
effect
of
ACE
inhibitors
.
This
interaction
should
be
given
consideration
in
patients
taking
NSAIDs
concomitantly
with
ACE
inhibitors
.
:
Clinical
studies
,
as
well
as
post-marketing
observations
,
have
shown
that
NSAIDs
can
reduce
the
natriuretic
effect
of
and
thiazides
in
some
patients
.
This
response
has
been
attributed
to
inhibition
of
renal
prostaglandin
synthesis
.
During
concomitant
therapy
of
Ponstel
with
,
the
patient
should
be
observed
closely
for
signs
of
renal
failure
,
as
well
as
to
assure
efficacy
.
:
NSAIDs
have
produced
an
elevation
of
plasma
levels
and
a
reduction
in
renal
clearance
.
The
mean
minimum
concentration
increased
15
%
and
the
renal
clearance
was
decreased
by
approximately
20
%
.
These
effects
have
been
attributed
to
inhibition
of
renal
prostaglandin
synthesis
by
the
NSAID
.
Thus
,
when
NSAIDs
and
are
administered
concurrently
,
subjects
should
be
observed
carefully
for
signs
of
toxicity
.
:
The
effects
of
and
NSAIDs
on
GI
bleeding
are
synergistic
,
such
that
users
of
both
together
have
a
risk
of
serious
GI
bleeding
higher
than
users
of
either
drug
alone
.
Antacids

,
ingestion
of
an
antacid
containing
1.7-gram
of
hydroxide
with

The

Given
the
primary
CNS
effects
of
Anafranil
,
caution
is
advised
in
using
it
concomitantly
with
other
CNS-active

Anafranil
should
not

Close

Drugs
Metabolized
by
P450
2D6
:
The
biochemical
activity
of
the
drug
metabolizing
isozyme
cytochrome
P450
2D6
(
hydroxylase
)
is
reduced
in
a
subset
of
the
aucasian
population
(
about
7
%
-10
%
of
Caucasians
are
so-called
poor
metabolizers
)
;
reliable
estimates
of
the
prevalence
of
reduced
P450
2D6
isozyme
activity
among
Asian
,
African
and
other
populations
are
not
yet
available
.
Poor
metabolizers
have
higher
than
expected
lasma
concentrations
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
(
TCAs
)
when
given
usual
doses
.
Depending
on
the
fraction
of
drug
metabolized
by
P450
2D6
,
the
increase
in
plasma
concentration
may
be
small
,
or
quite
large
(
8
fold
increase
in
plasma
AUC
of
the
TCA
)
.
In
addition
,
certain
inhibit
the
activity
of
this
isozyme
and
make
normal
metabolizers
resemble
poor
metabolizers
.
An
individual
who
is
stable
on
a
given
dose
of
TCAmay
become
abruptly
toxic
when
given
one
of
these
inhibiting
as
concomitant
therapy
.
The
that
inhibit
cytochrome
P450
2D6
include
some
that
are
not
metabolized
by
the
enzyme
(
;
)
and
many
that
are
substrates
for
P450
2D6
(
many
other
antidepressants
,
phenothiazines
,
and
the
Type
1C
antiarrhythmics
and
)
.
While
all
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
,
e.g.
,
,
,
,
and
,
inhibit
P450
2D6
,
they
may
vary
in
the
extent
of
inhibition
.
Fluvoxamine
has
also
been
shown
to
inhibit
P450
1A2
,
an
isoform
also
involved
in
TCAmetabolism
.
The
extent
to
which
SSRI-TCAinteractions
may
pose
clinical
problems
will
depend
on
the
degree
of
inhibition
and
the
pharmacokinetics
of
the
SSRI
involved
.
Nevertheless
,
caution
is
indicated
in
the
co-administration
of
TCAs
with
any
of
the
SSRIs
and
also
in
switching
from
one
class
to
the
other
.
Of
particular
importance
,
sufficient
time
must
elapse
before
initiating
TCAtreatment
in
a
patient
being
withdrawn
from
,
given
the
long
half-life
of
the
parent
and
active
metabolite
(
at
least
5
weeks
may
be
necessary
)
.
Concomitant
use
of
agents
in
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
class
(
which
includes
Anafranil
)
with
that
can
inhibit
cytochrome
P450
2D6
may
require
lower
doses
than
usually
prescribed
for
either
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
agent
or
the
other
drug
.
Furthermore
,
whenever
one
of
these
is
withdrawn
from
co-therapy
,
an
increased
dose
of
tricyclic
antidepressant
agent
may
be
required
.
It
is
desirable
to
monitor
TCAplasma
levels
whenever
an
agent
of
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
class
including
Anafranil
is
going
to
be
co-administered
with
another
drug
known
to
be
an
inhibitor
of
P450
2D6
(
and/or
P450
1A2
)
.
Because
Anafranil
is
highly
bound
to
serum
protein
,
the
administration
of
Anafranil
to
patients
taking
other
that
are
highly
bound
to
protein
(
e.g.
,
,
)
may
cause
an
increase
in
plasma
concentrations
of
these
,
potentially
resulting
in
adverse
effects
.
Conversely
,
adverse
effects
may
result
from
displacement
of
protein-bound
Anafranil
by
other
highly
bound
.
Interactions
between

administration
to
three
cancer
patients
over
a

range
of
0.025

The
effect
of

Hypotension
Patients
on
Diuretic
Therapy
:
Patients
on
and
especially
those
in
whom
therapy
was
recently
instituted
,
as
well
as
those
on
severe
dietary
salt
restriction
or
dialysis
,
may
occasionally
experience
a
precipitous
reduction
of
blood
pressure
usually
within
the
first
hour
after
receiving
the
initial
dose
of
.
The
possibility
of
hypotensive
effects
with
can
be
minimized
by
either
discontinuing
the
or
increasing
the
salt
intake
approximately
one
week
prior
to
initiation
of
treatment
with
(
tablets
,
USP
)
or
initiating
therapy
with
small
doses
(
6.25
or
12.5
mg
)
.
Alternatively
,
provide
medical
supervision
for
at
least
one
hour
after
the
initial
dose
.
If
hypotension
occurs
,
the
patient
should
be
placed
in
a
supine
position
and
,
if
necessary
,
receive
an
intravenous
infusion
of
normal
saline
.
This
transient
hypotensive
response
is
not
a
contraindication
to
further
doses
which
can
be
given
without
difficulty
once
the
blood
pressure
has
increased
after
volume
expansion

Agents
Having
Vasodilator
Activity
:
Data
on
the
effect
of
concomitant
use
of
other
vasodilators
in
patients
receiving

failure
are
not
available
;
therefore
,
or
other
(
as
used
for
management
of
angina
)
or
other
having
vasodilator
activity
should
,
if
possible
,
be
discontinued
before
starting

If
resumed
during

such
agents
should
be
administered
cautiously
,
and
perhaps
at
lower
dosage
.
Agents
Causing
Renin
Release
Captopril
's
effect
will
be
augmented
by
antihypertensive
agents
that
cause
renin
release
.
For
example
,
(
e.g.
,
thiazides
)
may
activate
the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system
.
Agents
Affecting
Sympathetic
Activity
The
sympathetic
nervous
system
may
be
especially
important
in
supporting
blood
pressure
in
patients
receiving

or
with

Therefore
,
agents
affecting
sympathetic
activity
(
e.g.
,
ganglionic
blocking
agents
or
adrenergic
neuron
blocking
agents
)
should
be
used
with
caution
.
Beta-adrenergic
blocking
add
some
further
antihypertensive
effect
to
,
but
the
overall
response
is
less
than
additive
.
Agents
Increasing
Serum
Since

aldosterone
production
,
elevation
of
serum
may
occur
.
Potassium-sparing
such
as
,
,
or
,
or
supplements
should
be
given
only
for
documented
hypokalemia
,
and
then
with
caution
,
since
they
may
lead
to
a
significant
increase
of
serum

also
be

also
have
this
effect

:
Increased
serum
levels
and
symptoms
of
toxicity
have
been
reported
in
patients
receiving
concomitant

The
coadministration
of
decreases
the

because
of
an
increase
in

are
possibilities
.
Because
Nalfon
has
not

shown
to
produce
any
additional
effect
beyond

this
may
lead
to
drug
interaction
.
Theoretically
,
fenoprofen
could
likewise
be
displaced
.
Patients
receiving
hydantoins
,
sulfonamides
,
or
sulfonylureas
should
be
observed
for
increased
activity
of
these
and
,
therefore
,
signs
of
toxicity
from
these
.
In
patients
receiving
coumarin-type
anticoagulants
,
the
addition
of
Nalfon
to
therapy
could
prolong
the
prothrombin
time
.
Patients
receiving
both
should
be
under
careful
observation
.
Patients
treated
with
Nalfon
may
be
resistant
to
the
effects
of
loop
.
In
patients
receiving
Nalfon
and
a
steroid
concomitantly
,
any
reduction
in
steroid
dosage
should
be
gradual
in
order
to
avoid
the
possible
complications
of
sudden
steroid
withdrawal
.
When

,
the
signs
of
atropinization
(
flushing
,
mydriasis
,
tachycardia
,
dryness
of

occur
earlier

The
following
precautions
should
be
kept
in
mind
in
the
treatment
of
anticholinesterase
poisoning
although
they
do
not
bear
directly
on
the
use
of
and
.
Since
barbiturates
are
potentiated
by
the
anticholinesterases
,
they
should
be
used
cautiously
in
the
treatment
of
convulsions
.
Unless
really
needed
,
agents
which
may
enhance
the
risk
of
hemorrhage
should
be
discontinued
prior
to
initiation
of
Lovenox
Injection
therapy
.
These
agents
include
medications
such
as
:
anticoagulants
,
platelet
inhibitors
including
acetylsalicylic
acid
,
sali-cylates
,
NSAIDs
(
including
ketorolac
tromethamine
)
,
,
or
.
If
co-administration
is
essential
,
conduct
close
clinical
and
laboratory
monitoring
.
Auranofin
should
be
avoided
by
patients
with
a
history
of
serious
reaction
to
any
medication
,
including
Solganal
and
Myochrysine
.
Auranofin
should
not
be
used
together
with
(
Depen
,
Cuprimine
)
,
another
arthritis
medication

It
should
also
be
avoided
in
patients
with
blood
,
liver
or
kidney
diseases
,
recent
radiation
treatment
,
or
uncontrolled
diabetes

their
practitioners
any

[
The
effect
of
sandimmune
on
the
activity
of
mixed-function
mono-oxidases
in
the
liver
microsomes
]
The
effects
of
the
immunodepressant
--
the
drug
sandimmune
--
on
hepatic
microsomal
monooxygenase
activities
were
studied
.
The
agent
was
found
to
produce
some
inhibiting
activity
against
hepatic
microsomal
7-ethoxycoumarine
deethylase
in
male
Wistar
rats
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
experiments
.
When
given
in
a
dose
of
50
mg/kg
,
sandimmune
produced
no
statistically
significant
effect
on
the
duration
of
hexanal-induced
sleep
in
mice
.
The
findings
suggest
that
the
agent
has
slight
effects
on
the
tested
activities
.
The
use
of
FLUDARA
FOR
INJECTION
in
combination
with
pentostatin
is
not
recommended
due
to
the
risk
of
severe
pulmonary
toxicity
.
Concomitant
treatment
with
thrombolytics
(
eg
,
rt-PA
or
streptokinase
)
may
:
-
increase
the
risk
of
bleeding
complications
-
considerably
enhance
the
effect
of
REFLUDAN
on
aPTT
prolongation
Concomitant
treatment
with
coumarin
derivatives
(
vitamin
K
antagonists
)
and
that
affect
platelet
function
may
also
increase
the
risk
of
bleeding
.
The
pharmacokinetic
interactions
listed
below
are
potentially
clinically
important
.
Drugs
that
induce
hepatic
enzymes
such
as
,
and
may
increase
the
clearance
of
corticosteroids
and
may
require
increases
in
dose
to
achieve
the
desired
response
.
Drugs
such
as
and
may
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
corticosteroids
and
thus
decrease
their
clearance
.
Therefore
,
the
dose
of
should
be
titrated
to
avoid
steroid
toxicity
.
Corticosteroids
may
increase
the
clearance
of
chronic
high
dose
.
This
could
lead
to
decreased
serum
levels
or
increase
the
risk
of
toxicity
when
is
withdrawn
.
should
be
used
cautiously
in
conjunction
with
corticosteroids
in
patients
suffering
from
hypoprothrombinemia
.
The
effect
of
corticosteroids
on
oral
anticoagulants
is
variable
.
There
are
reports
of
enhanced
as
well
as
diminished
effects
of
anticoagulants
when
given
concurrently
with
corticosteroids
.
Therefore
,
coagulation
indices
should
be
monitored
to
maintain
the
desired
effect
.
The
following
drug
interactions
were
observed
in
some
patients
undergoing
treatment
with
oral
allopurinol
.
Although
the
pattern
of
use
for
oral
allopurinol
includes
longer
term
therapy
,
particularly
for
gout
and
renal
calculi
,
the
experience
gained
may
be
relevant
.
Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine
:
Allopurinol
inhibits
the
enzymatic
oxidation
of
mercaptopurine
and
to
6-thiouric
acid
.
This
oxidation
,
which
is
catalyzed
by
xanthine
oxidase
,
inactivates
mercaptopurine
.
In
patients
receiving
mercaptopurine
(
Purinethol
)
or
(
Imuran
)
,
the
concomitant
administration
of
300-600
mg
of
allopurinol
per
day
will
require
a
reduction
in
dose
to
approximately
one-third
to
one-fourth
of
the
usual
dose
of
mercaptopurine
or
.
Subsequent
adjustment
of
doses
of
mercaptopurine
or
should
be
made
on
the
basis
of
therapeutic
response
and
the
appearance
of
toxic
effects
.
:
It
has
been
reported
that
allopurinol
prolongs
the
half-life
of
the
,
.
The
clinical
basis
of
this
drug
interaction
has
not
been
established
but
should
be
noted
when
allopurinol
is
given
to
patients
already
on
therapy
.
Consequently
,
prothrombin
time
should
be
reassessed
periodically
in
patients
receiving
both
.
Uricosuric
Agents
:
Since
the
excretion
of
oxipurinol
is
similar
to
that
of
urate
,
uricosuric
agents
,
which
increase
the
excretion
of
urate
,
are
also
likely
to
increase
the
excretion
of
oxipurinol
and
thus
lower
the
degree
of
inhibition
of
xanthine
oxidase
.
The
concomitant
administration
of
uricosuric
agents
and
allopurinol
has
been
associated
with
a
decrease
in
the
excretion
of
oxypurines
(
hypoxanthine
and
xanthine
)
and
an
increase
in
urinary
uric
acid
excretion
compared
with
that
observed
with
allopurinol
alone
.
Although
clinical
evidence
to
date
has
not
demonstrated
renal
precipitation
of
oxypurines
in
patients
either
on
allopurinol
alone
or
in
combination
with
uricosuric
agents
,
the
possibility
should
be
kept
in
mind
.
Thiazide
Diuretics
:
The
reports
that
the
concomitant
use
of
allopurinol
and
thiazide
may
contribute
to
the
enhancement
of
allopurinol
toxicity
in
some
patients
have
been
reviewed
in
an
attempt
to
establish
a
cause-and-effect
relationship
and
a
mechanism
of
causation
.
Review
of
these
case
reports
indicates
that
the
patients
were
mainly
receiving
thiazide
for
hypertension
and
that
tests
to
rule
out
decreased
renal
function
secondary
to
hypertensive
nephropathy
were
not
often
performed
.
In
those
patients
in
whom
renal
insufficiency
was
documented
,
however
,
the
recommendation
to
lower
the
dose
of
allopurinol
was
not
followed
.
Although
a
causal
mechanism
and
a
cause-and-effect
relationship
have
not
been
established
,
current
evidence
suggests
that
renal
function
should
be
monitored
in
patients
on
thiazide
and
allopurinol
even
in
the
absence
of
renal
failure
,
and
dosage
levels
should
be
even
more
conservatively
adjusted
in
those
patients
on
such
combined
therapy
if
diminished
renal
function
is
detected
..
Ampicillin/Amoxicillin
:
An
increase
in
the
frequency
of
skin
rash
has
been
reported
among
patients
receiving
or
concurrently
with
allopurinol
compared
to
patients
who
are
not
receiving
both
.
The
cause
of
the
reported
association
has
not
been
established
.
Cytotoxic
Agents
:
Enhanced
bone
marrow
suppression
by
and
other
cytotoxic
agents
has
been
reported
among
patients
with
neoplastic
disease
,
except
leukemia
,
in
the
presence
of
allopurinol
.
However
,
in
a
well-controlled
study
of
patients
with
lymphoma
on
combination
therapy
,
allopurinol
did
not
increase
the
marrow
toxicity
of
patients
treated
with
,
,
,
procarbazine
and/or
mechlorethamine
.
Chlorpropamide
:
Chlorpropamide
's
plasma
half-life
may
be
prolonged
by
allopurinol
,
since
allopurinol
and
may
compete
for
excretion
in
the
renal
tubule
.
The
risk
of
hypoglycemia
secondary
to
this
mechanism
may
be
increased
if
allopurinol
and
are
given
concomitantly
in
the
presence
of
renal
insufficiency
.
:
Reports
indicate
that
levels
may
be
increased
during
concomitant
treatment
with
allopurinol
sodium
for
injection
.
Monitoring
of
levels
and
possible
adjustment
of
dosage
should
be
considered
when
these
are
co-administered
.
's
conversion
to
inactive
metabolites
has
been
shown
to
be
catalyzed
by
xanthine
oxidase
from
rat
liver
.
The
clinical
significance
,
if
any
,
of
these
observations
is
unknown
.
Clindamycin
has
been
shown
to
have
neuromuscular
blocking
properties
that
may
enhance
the
action
of
other
neuromuscular
blocking
agents
.
Therefore
,
it
should
be
used
with
caution
in
patients
receiving
such
agents
.
Antagonism
has
been
demonstrated
between
and
in
vitro
.
Because
of
possible
clinical
significance
,
these
two
should
not
be
administered
concurrently
.
Angiomax
does
not
exhibit
binding
to
plasma
proteins
(
other
than
thrombin
)
or
red
blood
cells
.
In
clinical
trials
in
patients
undergoing
PTCA/PCI
,
co-administration
of
Angiomax
with
,
,
thrombolytics
or
glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa
inhibitors
was
associated
with
increased
risks
of
major
bleeding
events
compared
to
patients
not
receiving
these
concomitant
medications
.
There
is
no
experience
with
co-administration
of
Angiomax
and
plasma
expanders
such
as
.
Angiomax
should
be
used
with
caution
in
patients
with
disease
states
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
bleeding
.
Immunogenicity/Re-exposure
:
In
in
vitro
studies
,
Angiomax
exhibited
no
platelet
aggregation
response
against
sera
from
patients
with
a
history
of
HIT/HITTS
.
Among
494
subjects
who
received
Angiomax
in
clinical
trials
and
were
tested
for
antibodies
,
2
subjects
had
treatment-emergent
positive
bivalirudin
antibody
tests
.
Neither
subject
demonstrated
clinical
evidence
of
allergic
or
anaphylactic
reactions
and
repeat
testing
was
not
performed
.
Nine
additional
patients
who
had
initial
positive
tests
were
negative
on
repeat
testing
.
Preliminary
evidence
suggests
that
inhibits
mebendazole
metabolism
and
may
result
in
an
increase
in
plasma
concentrations
of
mebendazole
.
Dimenhydrinate
may
decrease
emetic
response
to
.
Tissue
culture
and
animal
studies
indicate
that
ELSPAR
can
diminish
or
abolish
the
effect
of
on
malignant
cells.14
This
effect
on
activity
persists
as
long
as
plasma
asparagine
levels
are
suppressed
.
These
results
would
seem
to
dictate
against
the
clinical
use
of
with
ELSPAR
,
or
during
the
period
following
ELSPAR
therapy
when
plasma
asparagine
levels
are
below
normal
.
Differential
actions
of
intrathecal
naloxone
on
blocking
the
tail-flick
inhibition
induced
by
intraventricular
beta-endorphin
and
in
rats
.
In
the
present
study
,
it
is
proposed
that
the
opioids
applied
to
supraspinal
brain
sites
produced
their
analgesic
effects
by
the
activation
of
different
descending
pain
inhibitory
systems
.
The
blockade
of
the
spinal
endorphinergic
system
by
intrathecal
naloxone
on
the
production
of
tail-flick
inhibition
induced
by
intraventricular
beta-endorphin
and
was
then
studied
.
Intraventricular
injection
of
beta-endorphin
and
produced
an
inhibition
of
the
tail-flick
response
to
the
heat
stimulus
in
rats
.
Intrathecal
injection
of
naloxone
at
doses
of
0.4
to
40
micrograms
caused
a
dose-related
blockade
of
the
inhibition
of
the
tail-flick
response
induced
by
intraventricular
injection
of
beta-endorphin
,
and
a
high
dose
of
naloxone
(
40
micrograms
)
completely
blocked
the
tail-flick
inhibition
induced
by
intraventricular
beta-endorphin
(
16
micrograms
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
intrathecal
naloxone
(
12-120
micrograms
)
had
only
a
very
weak
effect
on
the
tail-flick
inhibition
induced
by
intraventricular
(
40
micrograms
)
.
Intraventricular
injection
of
naloxone
at
doses
of
1.2
to
12
micrograms
equally
antagonized
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
the
tail-flick
inhibition
induced
by
intraventricular
beta-endorphin
and
.
The
results
indicate
that
a
spinal
naloxone-sensitive
endorphinergic
system
is
involved
in
the
production
of
beta-endorphin
but
not
morphine-induced
tail-flick
inhibition
,
and
suggest
that
intraventricular
beta-endorphin
and
elicit
their
pharmacological
actions
via
the
activation
of
different
descending
pain
inhibitory
systems
;
descending
epsilon
and
mu
systems
for
beta-endorphin
and
,
respectively
,
are
proposed
.

When
Bezalip
or
Bezalip
retard
is
used
at
the
same
time
as
other
medicines
or
substances
the
following
interactions
must
be
taken
into
account
:
-
Bezalip
and
Bezalip
retard
may
enhance
the
action
of
anticoagulants
of
the
coumarin
type
.
For
this
reason
,
the
dose
of
the
should
be
reduced
by
30
-
50
%
at
the
start
of
treatment
with
Bezalip
or
Bezalip
retard
and
then
titrated
according
to
the
blood
clotting
parameters
.
-
The
action
of
sulphonylureas
and
may
be
enhanced
by
Bezalip
or
Bezalip
retard
.
This
may
be
due
to
an
improved
utilization
with
simultaneous
reduction
in
requirement
.
-
In
isolated
cases
,
a
pronounced
though
reversible
,
impairment
of
renal
function
(
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
serum
creatinine
level
)
has
been
reported
in
organ
transplant
patients
receiving
immuno-suppressant
therapy
and
concomitant
bezafibrate
.
Accordingly
,
renal
function
should
be
closely
monitored
in
these
patients
and
,
in
the
event
of
relevant
significant
changes
in
laboratory
parameters
,
bezafibrate
should
,
if
necessary
,
be
discontinued
.
-
When
Bezalip
or
Bezalip
retard
is
used
concurrently
with
anion-exchange
resins
(
e.g
.
cholestryramine
)
,
an
interval
of
at
least
2
hours
should
be
maintained
between
the
two
medicines
,
since
the
absorption
of
Bezalip
or
Bezalip
retard
is
impaired
.
-
Perhexiline
hydrogen
maleate
or
MAO-inhibitors
(
with
hepatotoxic
potential
)
must
not
be
administered
together
with
Bezalip
or
Bezalip
retard

,
and
the

is
only
about
80

Co-administration
of
inhibitors
(

lead
to
several-
fold
increases
in
the
plasma

either
due
to
an
increase
in
bioavailability
or
due
to
a
decrease
in

.
These
increases
in

may
lead
to
increased

)
.
These
effects
have
been
observed
with
co-administration

.
Caution
should
be
used
when

A
conservative
approach
to

be
taken

also
reduced
to
approximately
6
%
of

Drugs
Affecting
Hepatic
Metabolism
The
metabolism

of
REMERON
SolTab
(
mirtazapine
)
Orally
Disintegrating

may
be
affected
by
the
induction

mirtazapine
is
not
a
potent
inhibitor
of
any
of
these
enzymes
,
an
indication
that
mirtazapine
is
not

to
have
a
clinically
significant
inhibitory
effect
on
the
metabolism
of
other

enzymes
,
the
concomitant
use
of
REMERON
SolTab
with
most
other
metabolized

these
enzymes
has
not
been
formally
studied
.
Consequently
,
it
is
not
possible
to
make
any
definitive
statements
about
the
risks
of
coadministration
of
REMERON

However
,
in
clinical

the
consequences
of

negligible
.
Based
on
in

As
most
entacapone

caution
should
be
exercised
when
known
to

No
data
on

Caution
,
however
,
is
advised
in
patients
taking
tricyclic

An
additive
hypotensive
effect
has
been
reported
with
the
combination
of
systemic

neuroleptic
therapy
.
Systemic

inhibit
the
production
of
catecholamines
in
response
to
insulin-induced
hypoglycemia
and
mask
the
signs
and

,
caution
in
using
such
as
beta-blockers
(
ophthalmic

A
total
of
11
clinical
drug-drug

,
,
,
,
,
,
and
.
In
these
studies
,
no
interaction
that
altered
the
pharmacokinetics
of

There
was
no

of
a
single
dose
or
multiple
doses
of
MYCAMINE
on
mycophenolate
mofetil

AUC
was
increased
by
21
%
with
no
effect
on
Cmax
in

respectively
,
in
the

with
MYCAMINE
should
be
monitored
for

toxicity
and
or
dosage
should
be
reduced
if
necessary

Micafungin
is
not

Distinct
synergistic
action
of
piperacillin
and
methylglyoxal
against
Pseudomonas

.
The
dicarbonyl
compound
methylglyoxal
is
a
natural
constituent
of
Manuka
honey
produced
from
Manuka
flowers
in
New
Zealand
.
It
is
known
to
possess
both
anticancer
and
antibacterial
activity
.
Such
observations
prompted
to
investigate
the
ability
of
methylglyoxal
as
a
potent
drug
against
multidrug
resistant
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
.
A
total
of
12
test
P
.
aeruginosa
strains
isolated
from
various
hospitals
were
tested
for
their
resistances
against
many
antibiotics
,
most
of
which
are
applied
in
the
treatment
of
P
.
aeruginosa
infections
.
Results
revealed
that
the
strains
were
resistant
to
many
at
high
levels
,
only
piperacillin
,
carbenicillin
,
amikacin
and
showed
resistances
at
comparatively
lower
levels
.
Following
multiple
experimentations
it
was
observed
that
methylglyoxal
was
also
antimicrobic
against
all
the
strains
at
comparable
levels
.
Distinct
and
statistically
significant
synergism
was
observed
between
methylglyoxal
and
piperacillin
by
disc
diffusion
tests
when
compared
with
their
individual
effects
.
The
fractional
inhibitory
concentration
index
of
this
combination
evaluated
by
checkerboard
analysis
,
was
0.5
,
which
confirmed
synergism
between
the
pair
.
Synergism
was
also
noted
when
methylglyoxal
was
combined
with
carbenicillin

:
No
formal
pharmacokinetic
studies
have
been
performed
examining
the
addition

:
The
addition
of
tiagabine
to
patients
taking
chronically
had
no
effect
on
tiagabine
pharmacokinetics
,
but
significantly
decreased
tiagabine
binding
in
vitro
from
96.3
to
94.8
%
,
which
resulted
in
an
increase
of
approximately
40
%
in
the
free
tiagabine
concentration
.
The
clinical
relevance
of
this
in

finding
is
unknown
.
Interaction
of
GABITRIL
with
Other
Drugs
:
:
Co-administration
of
(
800
mg/day
)
to
patients
taking
tiagabine
chronically
had
no
effect
on
tiagabine
pharmacokinetics
.
:
A
single
10
mg
dose
of
tiagabine
did
not
affect
the
pharmacokinetics
of
at
steady
state
.
:
No
significant
differences
were
observed
in
the
steady-state
pharmacokinetics
of
or
with
the
addition
of
tiagabine
given
as
a
single
dose
.
Prothrombin
times
were
not
affected
by
tiagabine
.
:
Concomitant
administration
of
tiagabine
did
not
affect
the
steady-state
pharmacokinetics
of
or
the
mean
daily
trough
serum
level
of
.
Ethanol
or
Triazolam
:
No
significant
differences
were
observed
in
the
pharmacokinetics
of
(
0.125
mg
)
and
tiagabine
(
10
mg
)
when
given
together
as
a
single
dose
.
The
pharmacokinetics
of
were
not
affected
by
multiple-dose
administration
of
tiagabine
.
Tiagabine
has
shown
no
clinically
important
potentiation
of
the
pharmacodynamic
effects
of
triazo
lam
or
.
Because
of
the
possible
additive
effects
of
that
may
depress
the
nervous
system
,
or
should
be
used
cautiously
in
combination
with
tiagabine
.
Oral
Contraceptives
:
Multiple
dose
administration
of
tiagabine
(
8
mg/day
monotherapy
)
did
not
alter
the
pharmacokinetics
of
oral
contraceptives
in
healthy
women
of
childbearing
age
.
Antipyrine
:
Antipyrine
pharmacokinetics
were
not
significantly
different
before
and
after
tiagabine
multiple-dose
regimens
.
This
indicates
that
tiagabine
does
not
cause
induction
or
inhibition
of
the
hepatic
microsomal
enzyme
systems
responsible
for
the
metabolism
of

Interaction
of
GABITRIL
with
Highly
Protein
Bound
Drugs
:
In

data
showed
that
tiagabine
is
96
%
bound
to
human
plasma
protein
and
therefore
has
the
potential
to
interact
with

Such
an
interaction
can
potentially
lead
to
higher

The
concomitant
use
of
other
CNS
depressants
including
sedatives
,
hypnotics
,
tranquilizers
,
general
anesthetics
,
phenothiazines
,
other
opioids
,
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
monoamine
oxidase
(
MAO
)
inhibitors

may
produce
additive
CNS
depressant
effects
.
When
such
combined
therapy
is
contemplated
,
the
dose
of
one
or
both
agents
should
be
reduced
.
Anticholinergics
or
other
medications
with
anticholinergic
activity
when
used
concurrently
with
opioid
analgesics
may
result
in
increased
risk

and/or
severe
constipation
,
which
may
lead
to
paralytic
ileus

It
has
been
reported
that
the
incidence
of
bradycardia
was
increased
when
oxymorphone
was
combined
with
for
induction
of

In
addition
,
CNS
toxicity
has
been
reported
(
confusion
,
disorientation
,
respiratory
depression
,
apnea
,
seizures
)
following
coadministration
of
with
opioid
analgesics
;
no
clear-cut
cause

relationship
was
established

Interaction
of
and
in
rats
.
The
interaction
of
intramuscularly
injected
and
its
N-demethylated
metabolite
(
metabolite
I
)
with
was
evaluated
in
rats
.
Five
,
10
,
20
,
or
50
mg/kg
of
alone
or
20
,
50
,
or
100
mg/kg
of
metabolite
I
alone
produced
less
than
10
minutes
of
hypnosis
.
However
,
anesthetic
requirement
(
i.e.
,
MAC
)
was
depressed
in
a
dose-dependent
fashion
as
much
as
56
%
1-2
hours
and
as
much
as
14
%
5-6
hours
after
injection
of
,
50
mg/kg
,
im
.
The
reduction
in
MAC
was
correlated
with
brain
levels
of
or
metabolite
I
,
suggesting
a
:
metabolite
I
potency
ration
of
3:1
.
The
half-life
of
in
plasma
and
brain
was
longer
in
the
presence
of

when
was
given
alone
.
It
is
concluded
that
is
not
a
short-acting
drug
and
that
concomitant
use
with
would
be
expected
to
prolong
further
the
duration
of
its
action
on
the
central
nervous
system
.
