# Mining Unstructured Data: Named Entity Recognition

The aim of this project is to set up a system for discovering named entities in text. Specifically, the focus lies on extracting the names of drugs, drug groups or drug brands from a collection of sentences.

## Structure of this repo

* For simplicity, the full dataset used can be found in the [`data/`](data/) folder.
* The `main` branch is reserved for the baseline code, provided by the professors, and this branch is protected to disallow any modifications.
* Each experiment is devised and implemented in branches, and once an interesting result is reached, a new pull request is opened.
> [!NOTE]
> An **interesting experiment** is not necessarily one that yields good results, but rather any experiment that tries something new, regardless of the results it gives.
* A **workflow** will kick off, running all the preprocessing and training steps and adding a comment to the PR with the statistics of the models.
